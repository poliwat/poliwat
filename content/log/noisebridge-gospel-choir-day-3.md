Ran to caltrain carrying 30 pounds across two packs and a plate of pasta. Barely made it!

Spent the morning writing for the choir

The hole in my intestines deepened at the purchase of another train ticket on my credit card.

I'm writing music as if my life depended on it.

How can I do this quicker?

Writing the voicings using just simple operator in Ableton, quantizing, then importing that midi to musescore. That will be how I write the choral piece. I want it to be just choir and an 808 in a sampler that I play. So I play along to a choir. Wish I brought my keys but already brought a shit ton of gear. Had a ball on the breadboard yesterday - Kevin at noisebridge gave me one of his Ultrasonic sensors and I got it working within the hour. Ultimately it's going to be my octave switch, holding out my arm at 12 inches and under will go down and holding my arm past 12 inches will go up. Like a switch. Or it could be a pitch bend on the entire thing.

But first I need to write a script that takes the distance and changes the hue of the LED first.
Like Paul said, the path to success is small steps.

*Tuesday 1043 PM*

NB and TSS auditions went well.

Cam and I worked at workcafe and I came up with how I'm going to make a 1 hour radio play.

Feels good to crack the seal on this caltrain.

Asim my new mentor invited me on our first date. Ahahahaha not that kind of date. A circuit trade show expo thing in Santa Clara. I hope to get some freebie arduino goodies. Though it's going to be lower level than that. Sort of like a peak of my future for the next iteration of poliwat (using FSRs). Tomorrow morning Asim will text me if its cool.

Had a blast on ubuweb after I got a basic analog midi device working with the teensy 3.0. It wasn't the sort of place to bring out a breadboard, but I did nonetheless. I like working on hardware for a some new reasons. For example, the goals I set can be attained usually within the hour. You're sort of hyperaware of progress. Also, I like getting proven wrong all along the way. Asim said I should draw out a schematic for poliwat. I will after drawing a smaller schematic for a MIDI controller to use with Ableton.

The process of doing this smaller project will give me the skills needed to tackle the 70+ connections project consistently. I need to design this well because I'm rough with electronics. I push all my electronics to the max, in a sort of abusive way. Everyone's different. The limits is where I like it. The point of convergence. Listening to str8 from the hospital that's what's making me write this way. Super.

jack showed me sky for the first time and she's got disco pop down. But I wonder if her lyrics are any good.

```
[Verse 1]
Poured myself a warm glass, and laid awake (10)
I prayed the Lord my soul to take (8)

I thought about you all day (7)
How we have the same face (6)
I fell asleep so confused (7)
Parts of me remind me of you (8)
How could I ever wish away? (8)

[Chorus]
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you (13)
And standing in the water with me ()
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dream

[Verse 2]
I wake up and I hear my phone ring
I hear your call and I let my phone ring
When I got into my car and drove away
I listened to the stereo play

I live by my own laws
Stick to my guns and hold my head up to the midnight sun
I hope the guilt will dim and fade
A fire baptism engulfed in my shame

[Chorus]
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you
And standing in the water with me
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
And I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dream
Only ever in dreams I wrap my arms around you
And standing in the water with me
I can tell you what I wanna tell you
And I hope it's not just a bad dream
Hope it's not just a sad dream
