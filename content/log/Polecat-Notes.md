Polecat Ep 1 notes
HELCAT
(wraps tentacles around the catnip)
Pretty soon it’ll be 2020 - that means ted talks were considered long for the young.
18 minutes is the new hour lecture inaurgual address
nothing lasts 12 minutes without a commercial break factored into the script
then there was nothing that went before the land before time after a spliff
so 18 minute ted talk, basic in my day is now the new Stanford full lecture,
and 5 minute lightning talks with proper meme campaigns are the new new for ingesting infotrashmation and I’m not going to die a cynic cause I just logged it here, first and again and I gotta piss. so no more bad days here
what do you do before you fall asleep
what do you odo before you fall asleep
what do you do before you fall asleep
what do you do before you fall asleep
what do you do before you fall asleep
read write a song
dance art ! explore !
what do you do before you call asleep
you keep falling asleep
you can't help that
fuck you I can! I will figure it out ! my body my sould I pray
What do you do before you fall asleep
make jokes make jokes !!!! ! !! ! !
make jokes ! !! !

I used to drink drive, a lot. Thank god I don’t do that anymore.
It was just like a little fun game between me and god and the law and a test of myself and everything and sometimes on those hard days, those real rare ones where you just can’t take your body anymore, can’t take your friends anymore, everyone has disappointed you in more layers than a farm of onions, and you just need to peel your skin off and upload yourself into someone else’s conscious	ness to not feel this anymore, I think yeah those drink drive days heading to and from Stanford to Santa Cruz to San Francisco and never getting caught in usually a loaned car from a friend’s, yeah, that’s where I get my confidence from.

POLECAT promo 1
not another stupid fucking dream
I'm tired of dreaming
always falls asleep and has crazy recurring dreams that take on lives of their own
polecat's dreams are getting in the way of how he wants to live.

says he'd be a vegan if he could afford it always has beer

POLECAT
I'm asleep right now bitch!

polecat's going through the normal degrees of help, psychological, medical, love, family, friends.

You OWE ME

you know what word OWE shares all the same letters with?
OEW. and that rhymes with JEW you JEW.

polecat == cat with a pole in its head

chad == surfer

The medical the love the love of my life, my lovely doctura, the judicial system, no one can find out what's wrong with me. But what's wrong with them? Don't ever listen to anyone when they say 'them' you can say 'them' and just about anything and it could be backed by something. Same with saying 'some people' or 'most people' I mean I hate that. I'm polecat bitch. My dads dead! I'm not going to let my dreams stop me. I'm not going to let my dreams get in the way with how I live my life, yes! > I'm polecat Bitch!

See THAT when you look in the mirror.

no one in the physical world could find out whats wrong with me
so I tried the metaphysical ones.

How many people have walked up to you and introduced themselves as interdimensional beings?

Oakland airport notes

Jack said he has an illness at ease with me because im closest to the two people who hurt him the most

We had kava and there was a couple getting shelly on kava love potions reading shaman instructional cards he wore braces she said she likes dressing up from time to time because otherwise when would she wear all these clothes she buys?

I told him he had a twisted little black heart

I said im on a quest to find my person outside other people

He makes me see that thoughts are moods

I said that maybe this is one long long forplay for Michael and him to end uo together in the end and im just a foreplay toy  between a couple of gay horses

I imaged walking in on them, stumbled into the wrong cupboard and they’re locked in a heated hating impassioned kiss that aggressivee way men kiss in the gay movies, like they want to fuck and beat each other up and do all the things they don’t get away with with women anymore — and I cannt even be annoyed becasue it would be too funny.

Why should Michale have love when I don’t that’s what he thinks as if they are the same person

im like uh hello? Give me some angency lol

Only after I realised it was all about him and him and him and Michale and him and Michale and him and them and them and him and his feelings about him and them and his which is maybe my fault for letting it be but I don’t wanna waste any more time trying to make him a better person

wheres dad?
What about me?

Mother Theresa quote on the kava toilet said - it was never about you and them anyway


I can only write about other people maybe thats a good thing maybe that’s a bad thing

Clever boys tell me my sense of self is lacking , who are you ? What do you want to do? who are u infant of a firing squad? Why do we have to organise fun dates? Ha! Im like why do we have to organise your lives? That’s a case of a heads up assholes  firing squad, never felt important enough for a firing squad that maybe women understand more that we can be and feel and think ambivalence

Ambilicance is something we live in
Maybe what makes women better for communities

Because definitve hard line one answer BEING RIGHT that’s just not true to complexity of minds and life
Understanding that  nuance they call it in creative writing class is key to forgiveness and understanding

Is that good is that bad is that both? niether and both its just the music

but im just listening !  YOU COULD TRY IT

John Berger said he doesn’t have ideas he just listens

Listening to the music

Who am I outside the other people outside you and them

My main conclusion is it doesn’t matter and im going to let things bother me only as long as deb did with the wet sofa
Don’t kill pooooo poo hahah ]

Polecat:Feelings the Sequel

What it DO Polecat, series
Quarter Hour, Animated  

• Logline: 1-2 sentences about your show that include character, setting, and conflict.

Polecat has to feel an emotion and journey to the next one they want.

Polecat is a cat with a pole going from it’s ass through the back of it’s neck, like a marionette. No one can see this pole, except at some point PSYCHIC ROSE, that calls it a shock top. Set in the real world where POLECAT lives a pathetic life, because they’re always falling asleep due to the narcolepsy   

And so we see Polecat’s dreams, unpacking what it means to have all that
As we learn slowly in the series, Polecat’s dreams are stopping them from living the life they want.

• World: 3-5 sentences on where the show is taking place, including time, location, universe and structure.

• Characters: 1-2 sentence descriptions of each main character including origin, goal, and relationship to other characters. Include a visual, if available.

she said you bring meaning to the every day ….
Be okay to be serious or take things seriously genuinely (or accept that u already do!)
Listen to criticism without lashing out
Re learn moderation
Superiority complex - find humble ground
Again
Red anger storm is the beating heart of all this - it distracts you, distorts things, encourages destructive behavior, feeds the voices telling you everyone is below you, and makes you dgaf! Find a way to fly above the fire storm rather than seeing red
I love PolecAt futurist

we walked and I thought about killing poopoo like a woman would, through his mouth. hot dogs and foods that don’t sit well with him every night as bonus meals i just feed him
if I kill poopoo like a woman would does that make me gay? why am I always looking for a reason to be gay? running away?

Oakland airport notes

Jack said he has an illness at ease with me because im closest to the two people who hurt him the most

We had kava and there was a couple getting shelly on kava love potions reading shaman instructional cards he wore braces she said she likes dressing up from time to time because otherwise when would she wear all these clothes she buys?

I told him he had a twisted little black heart

I said im on a quest to find my person outside other people

He makes me see that thoughts are moods

I said that maybe this is one long long forplay for Michael and him to end uo together in the end and im just a foreplay toy  between a couple of gay horses

I imaged walking in on them, stumbled into the wrong cupboard and they’re locked in a heated hating impassioned kiss that aggressivee way men kiss in the gay movies, like they want to fuck and beat each other up and do all the things they don’t get away with with women anymore — and I cannt even be annoyed becasue it would be too funny.

Why should Michale have love when I don’t that’s what he thinks as if they are the same person

im like uh hello? Give me some angency lol

Only after I realised it was all about him and him and him and Michale and him and Michale and him and them and them and him and his feelings about him and them and his which is maybe my fault for letting it be but I don’t wanna waste any more time trying to make him a better person

wheres dad?
What about me?

Mother Theresa quote on the kava toilet said - it was never about you and them anyway


I can only write about other people maybe thats a good thing maybe that’s a bad thing

Clever boys tell me my sense of self is lacking , who are you ? What do you want to do? who are u infant of a firing squad? Why do we have to organise fun dates? Ha! Im like why do we have to organise your lives? That’s a case of a heads up assholes  firing squad, never felt important enough for a firing squad that maybe women understand more that we can be and feel and think ambivalence

Ambilicance is something we live in
Maybe what makes women better for communities

Because definitve hard line one answer BEING RIGHT that’s just not true to complexity of minds and life
Understanding that  nuance they call it in creative writing class is key to forgiveness and understanding

Is that good is that bad is that both? niether and both its just the music

but im just listening !  YOU COULD TRY IT

John Berger said he doesn’t have ideas he just listens

Listening to the music

Who am I outside the other people outside you and them

My main conclusion is it doesn’t matter and im going to let things bother me only as long as deb did with the wet sofa
Don’t kill pooooo poo hahah ]
Ok getting on flight
