Dienrich&rsquo;s diary
“Nowadays, the prevailing view is that you should authentically rejoice and celebrate the spiritual happiness that this era has to offer, for it is a gift! People need to think about how many challenges the world has faced and how many obstacles and dreadful dangers it has overcome. They no longer believe that it is temporal distance that embellishes things, persons and situations and what makes difficulties and problems fade away and be forgotten.

                             I discovered one of the biggest thrills.
But first I will begin with the start of the night, at an old engineer type friend named Thomas from back in my Community College days. He held the BBQ at a house real close to one of the elementary schools I went to. It was interesting because I remember doing motocross as a kid with a friend that used to live there. There used to be a huge nice dirt motocross track in the backyard, but it had since been bulldozed.

                          <p>
                             I&rsquo;m broke because I stopped working my web development job over a month ago. I&rsquo;m out of money. I&rsquo;m on a spending freeze. Being home is useful for that.
We were joking the other night and Chad said a good one &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so broke my most broke friend said I was broke&rdquo;
When you are this broke you can see price tags on all your possessions. I made a pact to sell anything that isn&rsquo;t related to Poliwat.

I&rsquo;m on a toliet. Diahrea is running out of my ass while Chopin&rsquo;s Scherzo No. 2 in B flat plays.
There&rsquo;s an interesting mechanic humans do. I know I have Diahrea because once again I opened my day with an empty stomach and 3 cups of coffee. The stomach is no longer empty but I still have a black cup of coffee, right here with me on the toliet.

The sound map in Google Earth is going well. I look forward to travelling and adding all audio logs as points, then you can hit play and watch audio trails.
Google Earth is my Sheikah Slate I love this Todd linked it and I need to throw him 20 bucks https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/particulates/surface/level/overlay=pm1/azimuthal_equidistant=22.32,-219.67,225/loc=98.706,20.022

Moving and cleaning the room Day 2, very deep in it.
Moving gives you an air of sentiment. There are great as well as painful memories, and they&rsquo;re all treasured. The time capsule box has been selected and I have my items chosen to go inside, a fake degree Sean the provost handed me at graduation, and unopened Yoshi toy from Mcdonalds.

Captured memories is a main quest in Zelda. You need to find these 12(or 13?) lost memories across the expansive regions of the game.
Operation Captured Memories is the new official code name for the time capsule that we are burying at a graveyard in a couple weeks. So far this is what the box has:
 graduation certificiate from UCSC (which I&rsquo;ll write a letter to my future self on) yoshi model from Mcdonalds little note I left for Tara (Jordan Lipaz&rsquo;s GF) when I visited her trailer at the trailer park  &lt;!

It&rsquo;s time to go back online. I&rsquo;ve been sick since Monday, and still have a nasty cough. I feel weak and fat.
Going to retroactively share what happened on the off days, and finally work on poliwat.
My Zelda botw binge has been relentless. I love storming Ganon&rsquo;s castle and hunting down lynels. I want to make a music video with actual gameplay on something.

                             I&rsquo;m getting stuck on Ashley&rsquo;s Photography work. I can&rsquo;t look away! If she had a genre of photos I would call it sexy magic. She exploits the setting around these people to look much more attractive and magical than they&rsquo;re probably treated. The hopeless romantic in me says the magic and beauty are already there, while she uses photography to show and remind others of it.
Future tracks will have track art from Ashley and will be notated as such.

We have so many beats we&rsquo;ve made together, and this latest batch has shown some good progress. I only like one of these but the others were very fun to make with them :D

Haven&rsquo;t written much because life has been too good.
In the car with Kevin and chad, we&rsquo;re hitting paul&rsquo;s b day!!!!
Very excited.
I took a bath in a horse troph in my parents backyard. I got everyone I love all about jimmothy leary.
Last night a drunk guy stumbled upon us and it&rsquo;s still hilarious.
Me leaving my new hard drive in santa cruz was a huge mistake, but it&rsquo;ll work out

Cleaning out my desk, turning in my gun and badge. Last day at work, no one is here. Peter will arrive shortly and we will move stuff. I&rsquo;m hangingout around because this guy Brent had my hard drive and he&rsquo;s usually around here at this time. He may be going on a trip however, so I may have to leave town without it!

Meet your favorite author 🔥😌💌 FRANZEN GOT BACK TO US. Jack and I are very happy. You should go meet your favorite people, right now. Do it. Contact them. Be yourself. Be ridiculous, funny, and loving. I won&rsquo;t log what Franzen said to us just in case he&rsquo;s reading poliwat. I doubt it though, he didn&rsquo;t seem to figure out the .at part 😝 at the end of the url.

                             Tuesday 1120 AM I&rsquo;m listening to this new solo piano piece I started this morning. I was in a hurry because I woke to a text from the Dentist, I was 30 minutes late. So I ordered a quick lyft, couldn&rsquo;t find my passport which serves a dual function as my wallet, and made it up to campus. Angel told me however that I was too late but she could get me in for a deep cleaning at noon.

                             Monday 345 AM It&rsquo;s too early to think clearly. But I find myself wide awake at an hour where coffee is not easy to grab and without filters in my house. I lie in a pile of blankets on a sleeping bag in a white room furnished with only a music stand and a blue lightbulb hanging on the wall.
Yesterday was one of the best days of my life.

Woke up early so I could get some work done. Katie&rsquo;s coming by with a thermos full of coffee at 10. We will checkout the local graveyard I assume, but it&rsquo;s up in the air.
Tripping out to Slyvia&rsquo;s voice currently. It&rsquo;s amazing. One of the last tracks on our first album as Jimmothy Leary. There&rsquo;s about 10 tracks in my iTunes. James and I spent a lot of time yesterday bouncing tracks and figuring out the order of the album.

                             it feels good  -16 days sober A quick analysis of an online journal. Currently there are less than 10 readers (the latest being a 71 year old woman) I&rsquo;m finding that there are experiences that need to be documented, but are disadvantageous to write. It isn&rsquo;t a good journal without the experiences that matter to me, so it&rsquo;s a huge disservice to leave those experiences out. I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with simply hiding that content so I can find it at a later date easily but users won&rsquo;t see it.

Spoke with Peter on the phone about dreams.
I went to bounce hour at work, this 1 hour weekly pow-wow where you share what you&rsquo;re working on or do a presentation. I told everyone about PoLIWAT and scheduled to present it on the 28th of September. That&rsquo;s my deadline! To get a working mvp out. I&rsquo;m moving out of SC in about a week, and originally called Peter to see if he&rsquo;d be interested in helping me move out of my place.

What can I say. Woke up on a beach by mad river. The sun shone through the fog, and I recorded this:
 Stefan Jack and I skinny dipped in the ocean. There was a fisherman right next to us who got disgusted and left. We had a hilarious and exciting breakfast in Arcata. I haven&rsquo;t recorded much on account of dead batteries after the ocean.

The Uber driver had some colorful ideas to share. I oblidged, why not?
The trip isn&rsquo;t off to a great start :)
But I pumped out this with the uber audio I just got:

My mindset has completely changed. I&rsquo;m young. I&rsquo;m going to do the stupid unsafe thing for a while. I&rsquo;ll survive. And if I don&rsquo;t there will be a catalog of working documenting my journey. It&rsquo;s all about making tracks based off audio collected from the day.
Chris and I sampled his boat, we call it the old gwen drum kit ahahahaha.

The 12 steps to better abs.
Abs Anonymous.
And it started because for years, I have been keeping tabs on others with the same name as me, Michael Betts. Mostly to feel better about myself, but also I have this fantasy where we can all start a think tank and solve the world&rsquo;s issues. Or even better not solve them and make a show of our attempts.

I&rsquo;m supposed to be at work by 10 AM. My boss texted me an hour ago then called, but I&rsquo;ve been glued to this track [stefan]() and I worked on early into the morning. The soundscapes are from our professor and mentor David Dunn, and the woman speaking is my relative Cathy Nelson. Her work is so inspiring an entire album could be made from it.

 I&rsquo;ve been at work since 10 AM and have virtually gotten nothing done. (For my job at least). I can&rsquo;t concentrate to save my life. Today I&rsquo;m going to post some stuff up online to sell.
I can&rsquo;t work because life is short. I have songs to work on. I can&rsquo;t stop.
I&rsquo;m a slave. I&rsquo;m a slave to the beat. The family reunion trip changed my mindset.

####I was just about damn late to the train
Well I was 11 minutes late, but lucky for me I ride Amtrak and they are always late. I even had a few minutes to spare. I forgot my belt, my dad gave me his. I love him so much.

Instead of talking about it I&rsquo;m working on a track. This is the master doc for lyrics and iterations on the music.
  [intro] ( chug a pint ) (different computer voice each word) drunk.

                             Another unfinished project, but the idea is
song involving the final stage of life, and the lryics are basically your final will and testament. I imagine myself would be angry on my deathbed, and anger is an abstraction from fear. I have too many ideas to execute in one life, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m angry.
I&rsquo;m freestyling on this version. I was actually lying down on my back, in the dark.

Peter hasn&rsquo;t called back again - I called him yesterday.
Chad said he was going to be home in 30 and we were going to walk the neighbor&rsquo;s dogs together. He never showed up and I&rsquo;ve called 3 times. I&rsquo;m very depressed. It&rsquo;s day 2 of sobriety, and my only drug has been in how the day was spent. I worked on the Betts family renunion album from 8am - 6pm.

                             I wish I could share my favorite tape. I wish I could even state what&rsquo;s on the tape as well. But what&rsquo;s life without secrets? I&rsquo;ll take the USGOV approach. In 20 years it won&rsquo;t matter so it will be the declassified tapes.
In the meantime I will share a gem I don&rsquo;t want to forget - Tommy Betts the man who mentored my dad in music, and my father. I&rsquo;m playing some piano in the background, and the recorder I left on their table.

Brian and I each spat a poem, and this is the only place that will have audio from that night. Brian is a good writer and him and him and I both share the schizo gene.

                             My dad and I went to checkout a guitar on craigslist today. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;instrumental&rsquo; that we get a guitar on this trip, because the magic and emotions have been running high so far.
We had a great time with him, spent 20 minutes cracking jokes and BSing. Erik is hilarious. Towards the end of the transaction, Erik handed me the jacket seen in the picture above. It is my new favorite jacket, and I&rsquo;m dedicating my next track to Erik.

I learned a sure of a hell of a lot about the Betts family
Tommy Betts mentored my dad in guitar. Another relative said he came over to Tommy&rsquo;s house one day and said to him at the door &ldquo;Do you drink?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you fuck?&rdquo;.

This morning was monumental. I met the most family members in my entire life. We hit the bar Flannigan&rsquo;s ( right next door to the house my dad gew up in ) then the graveyard. That&rsquo;s my grandparents graves on my dad&rsquo;s side.

 Square breathing
  In middle school my therapist (whose email was hypnohupp) taught me square breathing.
You inhale for 10 seconds, hold for 10, exhale for 10, hold for 10, rinse and repeat.
I like to start at 5 seconds and then increase the time after a few cycles through.

                             Sunday 108 PM
I&rsquo;m pissed
real pissed. all I&rsquo;ve got done today is 25 pushups / 50 confucious canooes / took my laptop apart. heading to the store for the second time with my dad to get a bunch of tiny star screwdrivers. I&rsquo;m just going to get a kit of 1-10mm for this time and in the future.
Of the two meetings I scheduled with friends today, both forgot, and I should&rsquo;ve completely been expecting that.

                             There&rsquo;s this girl on the train. She has a nice SLR camera. For the past hour She&rsquo;s been sneaking photos of people in the lounge car. She might&rsquo;ve even gotten me, but I&rsquo;m not sure.
I got her though  this was recorded on the sixth floor of a stairwell at my uni dorms. I was messing with a made-up, by ear tuning. I don&rsquo;t know what key this is. I&rsquo;m tone deaf.

Saturday 116 AM
The biggest treasure of my life is my recordings. I collect audio every day. Normal slice of life things. I constantly record people without them knowing. I call it guerilla audio, and I&rsquo;m not going to stop. You can tell me it&rsquo;s immoral, illegal, douchie, lock me up, kick my ass, and I still won&rsquo;t stop.

 I have a romantic thought. What’s at the center of Github? I imagine a room where someone makes beats as a 9-5. These beats help fuel the rest of the programming community. This person makes an instrumental track for each git command. Each track has it’s stems available on github.
My day job right now is web development. I am a primarily self taught programmer. I haven’t gone beyond doodling.

Had 1 beer @ [jack&rsquo;s]() house and we livestreamed the Sims 3 on Twitch as prep for our play. Just wanted to report on an occurrence that happened a couple months ago. After my last breakup, I went a little off the rails. No, not talking ruby, I maintained a healthy ecosystem of smoke and drink each day.

                             I always wished I grew up in a household like this. I wanted nothing more than a laptop since the age of 6, but didn&rsquo;t get my hands on a computer until some extreme manipulation in seventh grade. I got a shitty Dell that would run World of Warcraft at 12 FPS in Ogrimmar or Dalaran. I was an incredibly annoying lock for a while but my real soul was ganking, dueling and general pvping as an undead rogue.

A major client we have here has a major page down for their international (french site). I really had to shit and drink coffee so I wasn&rsquo;t much help and now I should be working on fixing that, but am also consulting my buddy tyler on some flexbox use for a client of his.
Going to Michigan on Tuesday, so real quick notes, these things have to happen today -
