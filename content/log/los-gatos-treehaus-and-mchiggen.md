**Thursday 1115 AM**

@ starbucks, got a ride from Niko to Los Gatos, now I'll splurge the 18 bucks for a lyft to get to the station. I'm not making any money after it's all said and done, but getting 50 bucks to record a podcast is still great cause it pays for transportation and food for the day, and I get to edit my audio the rest of the day. Just cut together some mchiggen audio from a couple weeks ago in santa cruz. It was cracking me up, she's so funny, her and her BF James were great.
