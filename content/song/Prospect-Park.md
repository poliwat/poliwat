#### Lyrics

funny making jokes at wrong time  (I Know)

funny she saying it not funny right (I Know)

funny I DGAF making jokes all the time (I Know)

wrinkles on my face from smiles right (I Know)

Gods greatest creation was music

Satan's greatest was the word of god

my greatest hasn't happened yet

slipped through my fingers ( like my cars||God )

I'm in the maze
I got the faith
polecat in the bay
I'm barefoot

by dog beach

under oak tree

by dog beach

last act going down

speakers blowing out
music all night

got a set at dawn
but am I in front

behind curtain

met the cutest nuddhist budhist

spat ee cummings to me

now she work in tech

and she taught me this chant

nam miyo narang ey quo  (x2-4)

(chorus)
fuck we all audience
I'mma push every human up on this spaceship

//let challenge be our only addiction

I'm not alone I'm not alone
we just outnumbered go home

(verse 2)
funny making jokes at wrong time

funny she saying it not funny right

funny I DGAF making jokes all the time

wrinkles on my face from these smiles right

every day and lord knows best

and I may lay to rest

feel max feel max

why

cause I spit by blood

sing on my bones

and wanna sweat

under a tree

by dog beach

under a tree

by dog beach

speakers blowing out

working a pot farm

to flip by the ounce

here in santa cruz

met the cuttest buddhist

spitting ee cummings to me

and satans greatest was

the word of god because

god too pure for man's tongue

god more than man's words

god spoke to me twice

not a word was spoken right

//god took me to the sun
//where I met the others

___

not below this THIS )) __ (( LINE


```







and satans greatest was
the wor of god because

god don't fuck with man's tongue
god more than man's words
god spoke to me twice
not a word was spoken right
get it get this


he fucked with matrices


cmon you're old enough
to see past factions
young enough to make it
I'm dancing naked
not even nervous

know your audience
fuck that

need more challenge
we all that

```
