         <p>I&rsquo;m getting older or running out of gas in my lungs. Time to talk to that heart I keep over stimulating.</p>

<p><strong>025</strong></p>

<p>when you hear so much of people dying</p>

<p>related it to the plasted and wax paper</p>

<p>related to the convenience of hot n ready food</p>

<p>and the weirdos thinking</p>

<p>if it all gives you cancer don&rsquo;t worry about it</p>

<hr />

<p>i cant cure your white lady</p>

<p>but i cn love you in a new way</p>

<p>everytime</p>

<p>and the plastic</p>

<pre><code>
// 1 day after bonjos bday
// CHP chad mic copped a mirage  --&gt;

don't even have to write
nor record
yet I'm so happy doing both

we knew concrete could work
so well with lake!
and looking up at the sky
with my finger goggles
I thought this way too beautiful
for you to not be here

though I'm sure some atrium @ emma's work
would compliment the clouds
but here at the lake my ankles spashling round

you can see the deadly rip tows of the currents
byt looking up at the clouds performing
the latest circle of life.
every sailor knows about looking up at the sky to see
what's happening just beneath the ocean's harmless top

my top a paleblut dot today
and I reperesent with all due enthusiasm
so I the arrogant swimmer don't question
I supose up
the currents underwater are in line
with the wind in the clouds
and the musisans' only job is to document caputre destroy manipulate over think condolute
rule over forget about justify
nthing with
logic as church
no - stop, just look up
and I can't believe we're spending the most beauitful day in the city,
apart,
so close and so far
it breaks but not forgets
I'm healing you're recovering
we don't forget =&gt; but
I wrote that about 80 songs ago
Get with this arachnids

It couldn't do it justice
I feel too thankful right now to write
I cn just jump in the throw it all out
and what would that prove?
the beauty of this space has infected me,
deluded me (not the right words)
that sounds right to me

(but not enough paper for the states way
  too many chandeliers
  everyone I don't listen to is a walking Ad

  my plit to stop using my phone
  is that a borthday wish or last act or YEAH

  YEHA YEAH OH YEAH

  I'm getting older
  I can feel that
  it was so fun writing and
  singing about it
  before I felt it
  but noq id m chest is tight
  my foot hurts from dancing
  my throat corase from singing.....
  what left is there to write?
  when all the passion I cheatedall this passion that nearly killed me

  all this passion that took x y z years off my life
  The passion I hated feeling so much
  has left me now?
  [way way way way] x28
  I'm breaking ^this to use tor later

  clouds taught me how
  I play cloud holy shit
  waited 10 years to be
  allowed to go down on a cloud
  I fucking knew it in high school
  and its coming back now
  you gotta unlearn everything
  to begin to thrice in your 20's anyhow.
yet
doesn't matter what I write if my stretches don't get stretched
doesn't matter what I write if my flexes don't get flexed

Doesn't matter what I write if my flex's don't get flexed
Doesn't matter how it sounds if my belief in God

is too strong to consider it
a belief to me now
so what does it o to mean
me lil old mean me.?.

this days too beautiful to not have you in it
waited 10 years to play cloud
I'll stop trying stop thinking
I let the clouds teach me
stop listening to everyone
even me is the best shit
on your playlist
wow owwowowwowowo life is way better
not listening to anyone
cept recordings in raw

$$ from Lake to Cicadas

post office trust so far away
turned and shined light through the trees
directly at me me?
Find yourself
I'm giving you time to ifind yourself
you dumb bitch I love that
I'd never called you that.

The little boy waiting in line at the fountain left  
because I always count the number of gulps
I take, and simulataneously wondered
how old my dad is , so I
took 67 gulps
not cause he is
because I hopt that's his
age as it sounds right
he's right there making it....
making it past his brother
and sister and his father his DNA I share the same
and God I just have the mic all setup all day in the studio
on a beautiful day
and I'm more mute because my voice is thrown,
it's shot and if anything

a little more exercise, water, plants
will do the trick.

I'm at a park bench
she's quote unquote finding herself
I'm her , her her me I'm we're entwinsed

si the whole other part why
I'm mute my favorite recordings
are for someone,
just 1 person
like that's the vehicle
that note on a pigeon's ankle
someody lost?
It's like she's reminding me to love
myself while we're apart
and I need to go get brown dog
that's going to be the only thing
I can record 9)SAJIDAS
right now
brown dog my da'ds favorite book
brown dog
like father like son
brown dog
but I ran out of reasons to protect myself
and it she's so lost and indecisive
then all the more those 'whatevers'
reason you call 'them'
to love her ever more.
cause whose the most divisie
tolerant &amp; intolerant
jasdlfk, loving as I?
I know now this drinking fountain
really put it in my head
=&gt; call home record brown dog
record both love and legacy
on the good ones

and love and foregiveness on the others

so today forgive me for saying without saying
everyone's a pussy about something
a dick bout something
a dumb bitch about something.

o way else to shade it than to shake it!
at the lake finger goggles
scope clouds and not another
ass in this city
was ever seen ever again ...
and the planys tell me
some fucked up shit about us sometimes.
and that's the things, if you can't trust people,
you listen to the plants,
then you can't listen to the Plants
they want you dead!
and I'm a dumb dead white man statue,
praing a bird deuces on my Iron
non bald head cause
23 and me
was worth 1000 times the prices
I won't go bald


=--==-==--==-==--==-==--==-==--==-==--==-==--==-==--==-==--==-==--==-=

whens last time a schizo
was right?
too far into the future right

 and acted upon

 its amazing stopping
 to edit
