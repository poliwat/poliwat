**14:33**

Sitting on a couch and H is mad at me for going to the finefair grocery store cause she's all afraid of the virus and stuff. I put soap up my nostrils, wore a mask, and gloves - talked to Darlene on the phone and am excited that I have a used phone coming in the mail now, so within the next week I can finally dance around and work and walk and jump and YAY with headphones on.

Right now taking a break from the PBA work, I might have to record the next one cause H is mad but I think she's cooled off by now.   

**17:00**
If I was an accountant for my days as a poet, there'd be a small upwards curve, curving more each day.
