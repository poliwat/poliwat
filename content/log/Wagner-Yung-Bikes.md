Becca prefers open cabinets
Helen prefers teabags in the sink
gina prefers the most expensive grocery stores
I prefer ejaculating three times a day
and we haven't missed a dinner together yet
in the gothic dining room, old book
line the walls, and the windows view,
gives us the back of a jewish school

Read more Man and His Symbols by Yung, Becca made coffee, Helen is in high spirits, we're going to grocery shopping today after I fix the flat tire of Becca's bike. I have the patch kit but need some hex metal magic to take the wheel off.

Cassandra I never knew to be one that predicts misfortune but isn't listened to.

Quote from Yung man and his symbols, probably:

`You yourself must become a priest in your own inner church - in the chapel of your soul`
