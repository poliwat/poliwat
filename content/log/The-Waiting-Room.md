# The Waiting Room

#### Part One 1 - The Orthodontist
((((:: mouths up song cues ::))))

Remote pub trivia was the order of the evening. Everyone with a home in in the world had been in the house for weeks.

All including we, us and they them us going a little mad, and a little mad at each other because of the pandemic. All world governments issued a 'Shelter in Place' order to all citizens because of COVID-19, a fresh contagion that swept the air in her hometown. The town is a top of four large mesas, which are no joke. An aerial view of Los Alamos today shows deep epic ravines abruptly ending building lines as if a giant's hand had molded the landscape long ago with their fingers.

Los Alamos, New Mexico is famously known for the development and creation of the world's first atomic bomb.
Los Alamos is lesser known in the real world but well known in the gaming world as being credited with being the inspiration for the Tauren capital city in the World - of Warcraft. If you've played world of warcraft, Los Alamos most looks like the size of four Thunder bluffs, while the beauty of Thunder Bluff is a beautiful moment in game, for all races, horde and alliance alike. The pivotal moment of Thunder bluff is an amazing sight to see thunder...

Helen woke up in a daze. She remembered throwing up the night before, in a trash can that Becca had brought to her on the toilet. Why she clutched a trash bin while sitting on the toilet was unknown to everyone except Helen, who even in her drunken state remembered the brand new ikea trash bin in the restroom that was installed that day. 'STOP LOOKING AT ME !!!! ' she screamed as her friends Becca and Gina laughed in the crowded restroom, as she cradled the bin. They both left, but it wasn't long when Gina came back in carefully placing a bluetooth speaker on the side of the tub, playing Beyonce's Lemonade album on repeat.

But that was last night. This was this morning.
Helen rose from an alarm called " WISOMD TEE " at 11 AM.

Her body ached as she had nothing left to throw up.
Yet determined, she did not want to waste the day. She had to get her wisdom teeth removed.

Luckily she threw up everything she ate that night so she could technically be in a better position for surgery.

(((( journey to the orthodontist. arrives to waiting room ))))
they 




Helen keeps looking at the green linoleum, thinking it's the exact same floor they used in the film the Green Mile with Tom Hanks.
But today the day her wisdom leaves Helen's orifice, the modern right of passage for the middle class America, yes she is heading to get her wisdom teeth pulled today.

on the way she throws up in a bush, right outside in some bright yellow planter outside the orthodontist. the sign reads Dr. Chun's Orthodontistdonistry. She only throws up this little green bile.

(((((((((((((((way later that green bile she threw up looks exactly like the skin of the reptilians that are operating on her)))))))))))))))    

Dr Chun. flicks his thumb on her stomach. Are you dead? Knocks on her stomach 3 more times, which sounds like a hollow log being pitch down.
'Are you dead?' They both laugh.

'Dr. Chun you're going to knock me out, aren't you?' Helen asks.

Yeah don't worry, we give you some Sedation anesthesia. Don't worry you won’t feel any pain, and will have limited to no memory of the procedure. You’ll also get local anesthesia. He points at Helen's mouth to numb the site of each tooth being removed. Anesthesia is usually given through an IV.

We can't find a vein...

She wakes up on level 7 (but doesn't know it). she's in a cage in the dark, with some weird bioluminescent lights along the ground. || kind of like when the ocean || an alram sounds || wakes her up immediately || a couple scientists run through the room, prompting other humans in cages to scream for help to be released. || some military personnel, black ops agents with m733 commando rifles and weird silver shiny pistols start running the way the scientists came from. they sprint off, seconds later you here gunfire || really strange unworldly screams occur, something that sounds of something artifically constructed yet nonetheless coming from a live source.

climax = the grays and humans fall into a war, dead bodies everywhere, level 7 of the base where thousands of humans are being kept heavily sedated, dazed, or crying for help. humans in cages, boxes, vats, hooked up to IVS, humans with missing limbs.


they get her shot but it's in the hand and her hand burns in front of her eyes. She passes out as she sees the green beret fall dead in front of her.

she wakes up to a brightly lit operating table. there is a tube in her mouth, and she sees the reptiloids with their yellow emotionless eyes and scaly skins yet move strangle intelligent, deadly, like a conscious human being.

she opens her eyes and sees a flash of light but feels a sharp pain in her belly button. she looks down and can make out a large metalic but fluid looking tube that is pierced through her belly button, as it shoots something inside her stomach that gives her body full paralysis.  

 first one she loses all control of her body except her eyes. The reptillians are not speaking, but telepathically communicating and she thinks she can hear what they're saying but they're in a sensory deprivation room and she can only hear hallucinations over the the intense beating of her heart, that sounded like a rav bass drum. It feels as if a thousand knives piecre her body and shoot her into yet another out of body experience, where she sees herself in the orginal position in the dentist. she hears the doctors talk about how she'll wake soon and she floats back into her body. Must've been a dream it was assumed   




falling action = after getting shot intravenously on the operating table, second time. twice. first one she loses all control of her body except her eyes. The reptillians are not speaking, but telepathically communicating and she thinks she can hear what they're saying but they're in a sensory deprivation room and she can only hear hallucinations over the the intense beating of her heart, that sounded like a rav bass drum. It feels as if a thousand knives piecre her body and shoot her into yet another out of body experience, where she sees herself in the orginal position in the dentist. she hears the doctors talk about how she'll wake soon and she floats back into her body. Must've been a dream it was assumed   

resolution = it wasn't a dream during wisdom teeth getting pulled, after she finds a burn mark on her right arm.

The DON [Department of the Navy] conducts extensive surveillance and monitoring of individuals who are unknowingly part of an on-going program of manipulation of the human gene pool by competing non-human alliances. This manipulation was initially undertaken by the reptilian species, apparently to direct certain human traits in ways favorable to this species.

ote: Since the Reptiloids/Greys have basically failed in producing an actual "cross-breed" capable of reproducing itself, they may instead opt for the development of a 'race' of genetically-altered humans or implanted clones -- patched-in to the collective -- who have been fused with some degree of reptilian DNA and RNA, and once this has been accomplished transfer an individual and/or collective alien intelligence matrix into these genetically altered 'hosts' as they HAVE been known to do in some cases. There is some question as to whether the original 'soul' of the individual is removed OR suppressed when this occurs, both may be possibilities, and one would probably need an aura detection device capable of 'seeing' the multi-colored 'soul-chakras' in order to determine whether that 'human' has a soul or not. Nevertheless this would be one manner in which an alien force could infiltrate a human society. In other cases humans may be manipulated WHILE IN an altered state of mind while at the same time living a conscious life separate from and unaware of the induced alternate personality. I have encountered several cases, including 'my own', involving abductees who are living "double lives". In these cases an alien 'sleeper' or 'walk-in' intelligence-matrix has apparently been electronically IMPLANTED in these people via miniature artificial intelligence implants that are programmed with alien thought patterns and attached to the major nerve-centers of the brain. Recently there has been some progress in mainstream science in regards to programming computers with human thought patterns, 'growing' human brain tissue in a laboratory for use in 'organic computers, or direct mind-machine communication as is being developed for advanced jet pilots. The 'implant' in such cases house an individual or collective alien personality that is activated when the conscious identity is asleep. In this manner an alien 'parasite', whether malevolent, neutral or in very rare cases well-intentioned, may operate through the body of the host without the host being fully aware of just how his or her unconscious existence is being used or manipulated, for whatever purposes the aliens choose. As for the 'hybrids' that have been developed by the Greys, another problem with producing a ACTUAL hybrid is that humans have 'souls' whereas Greys do not, therefore the 'hybrid' must fall to one side or the other -- soullish human or soulless reptilian, regardless of what the genetic physical makeup of the "physical shell" may be. I prefer to use the term hu-brids to denote the hybrids who have been born with a soul-matrix and re-brids to denote those that have not. - Branton).

The hybrids would also be able to survive destructive ecological changes that the Greys believe will take place on earth in the near future. The hybrids I saw had the appearance of human children with unusually large heads and eyes as well as fine, sparse hair. Earlier, and unsatisfactory, efforts supposedly resulted in a more fetus-like appearance on the part of these hybrids. All hybrids thus far produced are sterile and unable to reproduce. However, all hybrids have well-developed digestive systems.

The implantation of bio-electronic (?) devices in proximity to the central nervous systems of abductees has been utilized by the Greys for several complementary purposes, but the most important reason is in order to have a more reliable means of MIND CONTROL at a distance. Such control is necessary in order to facilitate follow-up abductions and in order to prevent male subjects from having voluntary sterilization's.




Here’s what Dulce base is all about. But whether or not it is a conspiracy is hard to know!

Dulce Base, New Mexico

While some are spending their time scrutinizing Area 51 and thinking that's so important, Dulce is said to be the crown jewel that we're all being distracted from.

Function: Alien interface, Research of mind related functions, genetic experiments, mind control training and reprograming.

Levels: 7 Known -
Level 1 - garage for street maintenance
Level 2 - garage for trains, shuttles, tunnel-boring machines and disc maintenance
Level 3 - everyone is weighed, in the nude, then given a jump suit uniform. The weight of the person is put on a computer I.D. card each day. Change in over three pounds requires a physical exam and X-ray.
Level 4 - Human research in 'paranormal' areas - mental telepathy, mind control, hypnosis, remote viewing, astral traveling - etc. The technology is apparently here to allow them to know how to manipulate the 'Bioplasmic Body' Development of a laser weapon that can remotely cause burns and discomfort on it's target. They can lower your heartbeat with Deep Sleep 'Delta Waves,' induce a static shock, then reprogram, Via a Brain- Computer link.
Level 5 - Alien housing . "...The room is circular for the (electro- magnetic) generator is nearly 200 feet diameter and covers the fifth and sixth levels (extreme west south wing). There (are) five entrances (plus an escape trap door on the sixth floor) on each floor. Each portal has double door. The security is severe. Armed guards patrol constantly, and in addition to weight sensitive areas there (are) hand print and eye print stations. Here, is the device that powers the transfer of atoms.
Level 6 - Level 6 is privately called 'Nightmare Hall'. It holds the genetic labs. Experiments done on fish, seals, birds, and mice that are vastly altered from their original, forms. There are multi- armed and multi-legged humans and several cages (and vats) of humanoid bat-like creatures up to 7- feet tall. Aliens have taught the humans a lot about genetics, things both useful and dangerous. Level 7 - Humans in cages here, usually drugged or dazed, sometimes crying out for help.
Level 7 is the worst. "Row after row of 1,000's of humans & human-mixture remains in cold storage. Here too are embryos of humanoids in various stages of development. Also, many human children's' remains in storage vats. Who are (were) these people?"
Below Level 7 - Unknown other levels unexplored by humans. Aliens here. Exits into a vast underground cavern series, unexplored by humans, but suspected to be a huge alien culture area.
