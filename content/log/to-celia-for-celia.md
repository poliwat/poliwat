Tracks for celia vocals!!!

1. 'new moon new me' ()

### lyrics:
```
this part goes on for too long
```

2. 'Grasshopper my Grasshopper'

(I'm actually my own grasshopper at the same time as asking for one, so there's 3 internal GmyG relationships going on:

1. outside mentor && outside grasshopper
2. internal mentor && internal grasshopper
3. being physically on an existential hike and asking a grasshopper(bug) for guidance

)



this is what celia sounds like - a track stefan and her are working on, good vibes time life .... . ..  . .
