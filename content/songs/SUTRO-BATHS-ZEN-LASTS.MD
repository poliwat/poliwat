who knows at this point I have a nice buzz and I stopped by arvhicew today to see if jonah the main server guy was in to see when I couldmake an upload, but he was super busy it wasnt a good time - will try and just show up tomorrow ?

||| ||| ||| ||| ||||| ||| I'll just show up tomorrow cause life's short and I'd love to record brewster again. they wouldn't say no but it would be weird I suposed, but it wouldn't if I'm trying to upload like 7 hard drives of my own content onto archive in order to help people use it -  

but also the proposal but also life but also not a dollar in my pocket how am I to move out but also maybe becca will come in clutch but also maybe craig or peter will take me in but also I want to die most the time but also please just let me make media good for the people but also I can do producing for minimum wage but also I'd do it for free cause I'm about it but also help but also it's been weeks without a wallet now but also good thing Im cute she said but also Im 20 straws beyond my last straw but als helens back
