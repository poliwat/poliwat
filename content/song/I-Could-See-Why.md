#### Lyrics

```
I could see why - Dmin7 F Em7  (( Walk on the Sun on vocal pedal ))

Michael V1
I could see why
you want to be alone
but meet me at the shore
I know we got some more     

Fernanda V1
you want an easy life
painted all black and white
I could see why
its no way to spend my time

Michael  Chorus 1
and I don’t care
Fernanda
I do care
Michael
its not
Fernanda and michael
living our best life
x2

Michael
I love you

Fernanda V2
I’m not saying no
I just need time
why do you think
I need to be tricked

Michael V 2
why are you soaked
and your hearts so closed
theres nothing in your vibe
that makes me close my eyes

Michael  Chorus 1
and I don’t care
Fernanda
I do care
Michael
its not
Fernanda and michael
living our best life
x2


Fernanda and Michaela
and I could see why
and I could see why
you wanna be
collaborating
and I could see why
I could see why
you wanna be
in your writing
and I could see why
and I could see why
you wanna be
collaborating
and I could see why
I could see why
you wanna be
in your writing

Michael  Chorus 1
and I don’t care
Fernanda
I do care
Michael
its not
Fernanda and michael
living our best life
x2

Fernanda
I love you

Michael
I don’t want to shower
Fernanda
he wants the easy life
Michael
Thinking of my wife
Fernanda
You smell like woman




=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=—==—=-==-=—=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Michael
She wants the easy life

Fernanda
thinking of my life

Michael
and how it needs more mic

Fernanda
come on

Michael
out

Fernanda and Michael
come on out now
come on
come on out
come on out now
come on

Fernanda and Michael
come on out
come on out now
come on out
come on out now
come on out
come on out now
come on out
come on out now

-=-=—=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
NOT BELOW THIS LINE
-=-=—=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-




why are you soaked

I love the thought of
zoning out at the park
thinking of my wife
I smell like a woman


She is talking sex,
not sport.
Unless

she wants the easy life
while  I love playing hard mode
get married have kids did the trick

Michael
I could see why

Fernanda
you wanna collaborating

Michael
I could see why

Fernanda
you wanna be not dating

Michael
I could see why

Fernanda
I need to focus on writing

I could see why  I could see why  I could see why
-=-=-=-=—=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
the pain leaves my body
renado gave me molly
after telling him bout us

but my ankles busted
from all my skating

skating through
no handlebars mic
lived enough for three wives
be my first mic
subliminal in our best interest

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
I could see why
you need to
focus on writing

Life can seem long.


you can’t live o sun shine
