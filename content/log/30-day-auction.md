**Wed 1045 AM**

@ diridon - hitting palo alto to grab my phone from Avery and upload a bunch of old stuff. I'm going to upload most of this hard drive.


Rent was due yesterday, cam is loaning me enough for rent and then groceries.

I'm so stressed about money and I just want to kill myself most of the time.

I don't think I can even cry about it.

I'm just praying nikki silva reaches out soon.

I either have defaulted or am about to default on my student loans. My credit card is maxed out.
I have no job. But I have my company, and we have 1 client at about 4 hundred a month consistently.


And what else, I want to save battery so I'll type without being able to see the screen.

this is good therapy. Typing to nothing. Not worrying about mistakes, you know.

I'm spread too thin and just need a fucking assistant. Cause

today I hate this world and everyone it in

today I  hate the world and everyone in it.

I'm going to work myself out o this hole Idug.

I dug this hole and now I'm going to climb out.

It



at least I have a hot date tomorrow night :)


Going to finish up the dance piece as soon as I get to the station
