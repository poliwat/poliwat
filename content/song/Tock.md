#### Lyrics

waiting
news flash
find a new waiter

lotta pressure for the next track
5 albums out and not a single best friend knows that
2 more written
but doesn't fit analogy street
1 class short bachelors degree
mom's rough emotionally
but called me a genius visiting
came for 2 weeks to get a new real ID
reminded me in a note
its been 6 weeks
go the fuck home
in so many words

waiting on  what

1 class short a bachelors degree
all the women I date more qualified than me

most important woman of my life
sas I'm a genius

  

```

```
