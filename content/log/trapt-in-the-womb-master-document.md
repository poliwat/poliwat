[v1]
to be or not to be
not born yet I toothless
I cannot sin I cannot win
not yet person so I can spit the truth
it a blaze blue dot I being born to
trapt in womb while mother drinking in the kitchen
green str8 merciless fate god given
but god is worthless when you don't exist
that some food for thought
she at food for less
that some food stamps yes
no fear oh I choose not to be
our birth is but a sleep
our birth is but a dream
and a forgetting don't you see
dont be a slave to reality
I cannot see choose not to be
I choose not to be

[chorus] x4
Trapt in the womb fed up with this womb
Trapt in it lost in it high up in my mothers womb

[v2]

my mother's melody
holiest of holy
breaks my
umbilical bars
minor chords

my lyrical fertility
half brain no chub my ability

onyl progress I see see through chords in min


oh mom
I ate
I ate I fed
I ate my twin
don’t tell Auntie
or uncle Mike will take internet privileges away
hope daddy likes me
that don't always happen
I feel syncopation in her belly
hope my daddy likes me
even if I rap premature
early onset depression
I can already feel it




ohhh mom
you

grea

I too high up in my mother throne

fro mmama stomach to my ear
beeethoven over fear
I must be born I must be born

I jamming on these unbelievable umbilical chords
only progress I see through bars in minor keys
trapt in the womb
fed up with this womb
call a hampton so I can
hustly for a better womb

mom’s in a fog I can feel her steaming
dad likes to vape nation while she breathing
I don’t mind when I under
she in the pool doing yoga
spitin nursery rhyme

I ate my twin she was a weak child



my twin couldn’t trap so I
ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti


my lyrical fertility cast charm like civility
chivalry ain’t dead it just escalate
escape escalade escaaappeeee

finding finding finding dory
read inbetween the veins
the mother ways



yo know why babies are cute?!
cause darwin, call me darla
