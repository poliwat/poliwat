      <description>miss myself missing you - poliw.at [early release] 13:03
Freewrite #123089 &amp;lsquo;What a piece of work is man? Washing up dishes this morning plotting how to cut my dick off, I get too horny too often for this lifestyle. But it teaches patience, my current best reason to look forward to aging. Some men say it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Well yeah that&amp;rsquo;s probably right, but you have more time to develop your interests.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to explain it
but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it
every time
and
every fucking time
whter it&amp;rsquo;s overwhleming
or something beyond me
yeah it&amp;rsquo;s a bad tip beyond repairing
but also something tht no one ever knew</description>

Never drank in a whole foods
so its fitting first time you get drunk then tpy 200 words
a minute it feels plans out the window
80 words a minute it is
but feels 200 plus 3 tips
and an open card means I&amp;rsquo;m leaving happy
and my money isn&amp;rsquo;t anything
doesn&amp;rsquo;t meant anything
is nothing
in the land of the rich
and the free
until dont&amp;rsquo; have any</description>
