```
‘type me like your french girls’ she said

I typed her beauty looking not down at the keyboard
And typed the following words:

zit to the right of her lips ..
Looking down in my glass I see
Looking in the glass of wine.
The blackness of coffee the next morning
Into the voids we go
```
<!--more-->

```
Down downed glasses and more!
Campfires with smores!
DRINK OF LIFE, more, more, more!
FOOD IS UNSATIABLE
JUST LIKE PUUSSSAAAYYY
```
