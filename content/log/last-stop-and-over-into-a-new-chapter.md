**Tuesday 714 PM**

4 all nighters in a row; today has been a blur at best. Had a nice little practice with Jack in the local park close to his house.

The application for this grad program is due Feb 14th,
basically a week from now because I need to mail it.

That puts me in a little bit of a time crunch.

Tonight is a media night!

- update personal website
- update pale blue dawt
- write credits for 1st ep
- figure out tom's site
- update linkedIn
- log into right accounts across devices
- setup social media schedule
