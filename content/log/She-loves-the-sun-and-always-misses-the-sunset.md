Mila was always the last to get picked up after school.

'Guess they forgot about me.' She sighed and started walking home.

The lonely cholo was always outside on his low rider bike around this time. His gang was dead, he was a gangster without a gang. 'Hey bato!' The lonely cholo called at Mila. They were instant friends.

Now ten years later the lonely cholo is a drug rehabilitation programs counselor working directly with the mayor of their town. Mila is a woman in tech.

Toasting with the mayor a glass of wine,
'I love this town'
