<p>he knows it both ways of the coin</p>

<p>am I crazy for being down on the coin?</p>

<p>you’re crazy for not knowing the saying
money is the root of all evil

talking about the cost of anything</p>

is that so bad?</p>

are you crazy</p>

<p>humans are walking around</p>

<p>thinking it’s racist to speak in a mexican accent
while not being mexican?</p>

<p>these people’s brains have been infiltrated by the nsa</p>

<p>the discrete security agency of the most powerful nation in history thus far.</p>

<p>and the nsa has been infiltrated by an alien race that found and uses the earth for two reasons</p>

<p>A) to provide a computing center for discovering the answer to god</p>

<p>( an ind human analogous to neurons in the brain, of God’s consciousness from the human’s perspective, but it’s actually the individual humans are  AI, and the seemingly infiniteness of consciousness and conscious thought is the computing processes required for calculating the location of god, which is what the aliens want to do  )</p>

<p>B) to learn themselves about how to start civilizations</p>

<p>so they use these devices in order to influence the human society, so that it’s shaped more like a super computer. that’s why we had the industrial age

<p>hh</p>

<p>why do I hate rent?</p>

<p>hh cause rent took the life of Chessy, my 71` vw bus, whose memories we share are magic.
hh cause rent took my martin that my dad gave me on my 21st birthday. that guitar was the most prized and costly possession I owned.
hh cause rent took my mitsubishi mirage
hh cause rent tested my friend’s patience
hh cause rent showed me who believed in me and who didn’t</p>

<p>hh rent killed my laser cutter
hh it wasn’t the rent but hh but if rent was a ghost that was summoned and in a communal wifi board session in the middle of the woods and I called that ghost a pussy hypothetically that would be the reason the rent is the ghost that broke my laser cutter.</p>

<p>hh we all know this phrase, and forget it everyday<br />
hh money is the root of all evil</p>

<p>hh I wrote that, because I wrote it down just now
hh nothing written is anyone’s
hh all ideas are in a shared soup
hh all artists if they are not posers know this
hh but back to the phrase
hh money is the root of all evil<br />
hh when did money start?</p>

<p>hh that doesn’t matter
because you know why I really hate rent</p>

<p>cause rent is the reason
I’m separated from my love
rent is the reason I’m living in a tent in my parents back yard
rent is the reason
I regularly work myself down into breakthroughs</p>

<p>I’m living in a  tent my dad found in an alleyway</p>

<p>cause hh the bible didn’t say money is the root of all evil,</p>

<p>the bible said the love of money was the root of all evil</p>

<p>but</p>

<p>I am highly religious
I worship god all the time
I see god all the time
in everything!
that rock is alive with god and if you don’t see it you’re an insane alien!
I was even blessed enough to
have the experience
of talking to god
twice!</p>

<p>and god never requested that they be worshipped
which is why hh the bible was written by state
hh the bible was written by satan
hh real god wouldn’t want to be worshipped
hh saying its the word of god is satan saying that</p>

<p>hh sorry satan wrote the bible</p>

<p>well humans wort the bible</p>

<p>thinking they were doing it in the name of god</p>

<p>but were acting on satan</p>

<p>hh cause newsflash</p>

<p>I talked to god twice</p>

<p>and god never requested us to worship god</p>

<p>god is all knowing and all loving
god never made that request</p>

<p>if you can think about your relationship to god in physical reality terms
if each human was a neuron in gods mind
and if each neuron was a single cell in gods toe
and if humans were single cell in gods toe
they would be more like the mitochondria of that cell in gods toe
they would be more like the matrix fluid in god’s mitochondria in gods toe</p>

<p>so yeah the bible was written by
great smart wonderful well to do people
influenced heavily by satan
in order to use language
as a barrier disconnecting us
that is why I say break language
master language
there’s no verb or adjective for it!
but more like factor in the weight language holds
on an individual’s thoughts
and then the individual trains on mastering language
by thinking about everything in terms of
dimensional thinking
space thinking
time thinking
idk
and the human trains to learn nmeonically</p>

<p>and the aliens gave me these lines and I give
myself to the aliens
cause a good master knows
exactly when to submit and for how long

if you hear a eukuele
its an ad
and these are the most important ppsychocical studies
to making an egg {}}{}{}}{}{}{}{}{}
thats the devil speaking in th e name of god
i know lennon was shot for less than this
but I’m sorry
satan wrote the bible
not directly
but indirect
cause newsflash
think of scale in relation to god
and then conclude god never wanted to be worshipped
god never asked to be worshipped
and what you are are the matrix fluid in the mitochondria of a single cell in god’s toe
and the true is your relationship to god is much much more benign
god doesn’t need you to worship them
god never used language to ask you to worship them
the devil’’s main skill is working in mischievous and subtle ways
so if the holy bible was written
and it lasted this long
and there are still wars being fought over it
do you think the bible is the word of god
or the word of satan?
cause sorry
cause god is all knowing and all loving
it would be so convenient if there was such a thing as god’s word
but language is tool too blunt a tool
and my life changing experiences talking with god
involving dialogue but also like a million other things way more important that happened at the same time
language itself is way too blunt a tool for communicating
the infinite love and omnipresence god yields
that’s why the bible was written by satan
well not really
it was written by humans thinking they were listening to god
but it was the devil douping them
and every time
god speaks
a demon laughs
for god so loved the world
the most developed muscle, as well as historically the most common way the devil speaks, it’s as if they’re god
so know you know
because the more you talk the less true you are
and god is all loving and true
and never relied solely on words
in order to communicate
god is in everything
and people are gonna be pissed
when they find out the demons
got not just them
that’s the easy but
but got hundreds of generations of humans
to live act and die in the name of god
when all they were doing
was being duped by the devil
at least to some degree<br />
=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-=-=

it  happens

<pre><code>
changed my pregnant sisters religious beliefs

jus tin time for the second kid

paul and dad got annoyed

cause life too short

to be wasting it on talking about religion

which was my point in the first place

then 3 hours later

I missed it

religion is nothing but an action

and sure speaking is an action


but actual religion itself

isn’t ever talked about

cause there were humans walking around

when worship was all encompassing 24 7

in their very souls

and all of a sudden the devil came along and said

no you should pray to god

sacrifice your best meat

and give it to god

that is always satanic always was always will be

god never needed you to sacrifice your best meat

 and go to church every sundays

GODS CHILLEN !!!!

in california terms

god is chillennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

you need to show you love of god through

actions

through spreading the light

of unconditional love to all humans

we all know the saying

actions speak louder than words

use your actions to speak religion

use your actions to speak politics

and use talking for play and love

and give love all the time you’ll be alright

peace

can you give me a linguistically analysis of the top 40?
d
currently of the 40 tracks, the three most common themes were ::: :: :: ::
==-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Don’t
thats the name of the game i los txt thought
I’m chilled that would break many
when you lose a million dollar thought
but when you’re good
that happens every day
be chill and let it come too you</p>

<p>cause voices are a feed
ideas come to you
when you are good to the universe
ideas as to what to make what to do how to think
they come to you
no doubt
==-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
because in a dream the first humans
the first homos pains
they walked around
and worship was in their dna
they didn’t do it part time on sunday
that’s the devil
giving words to religion
in order to subtly and smartly and patientaly dissuade from positive action
that’s why church are set up as therapeutic
a place to recover
and that’s great we need to recover
i don’t know….. ALL THE TIME
but religion is acted upon
because it used to be 24 7 in our dna like it was in our bodies but now…..
for some reason
religion is more of a subscription service
like you pray this much you get this much
you got to church this much you get this much
you give to your community this much you get this much
that all sound like satan crap to me
because language itself</p>

<p>actually steals from</p>

<p>an all knowing
all loving
omnipresent god
I love endear and avoid on occasion
with all my heart
all my desire
all my soul
all my body<br />
all my mind
I give to them
because I worship by choice
they never asked for it
and I show it
however overly complicated
however illicit
however a conundrum
however plain stupid
all those actions are me
actin on free will
in the name of the all loving
omnipresent being I fell see hear touch sense hear
the moment I wake
when I’m asleep</p>

<p>and when I’m</p>

<p>and the moment language
when you speak to god
there is no refuser from god

<p>and the aliens don’t intervene</p>

<p><strong>2242</strong></p>

<p>working on the screenplay -</p>

<p>this is the state + brain dump of it in case I lose it as abackup, watching steppenwolf too</p>

<p>Motifs
Main theme is The Human and The Curtain, a relationship adventure between a human and their government. The goal being to have a healthy relationship, using poliwat as a metaphysical operating system for pursuing truth, by training on the boundaries of perception, extending beyond it, and always coming back home to base reality (this) in a way that augments it, deepens meaning, and makes you feel more connected to this world. Step wise this is achieved by constructing all challenging doses of reality that are true in that relationship, letting go of the noise, and making music along the way.
&lsquo;everything is leverage I&rsquo;m the new average&rsquo; - secondary theme that your demons/ mental illnesses/ shortcummings/ crashes/mistakes are all leverage towards whatever the human is focusing on at the time. Part of the POLIWAT OS, a major tool to continue progress despite setbacks. When you successfully do this, you feel like you&rsquo;ve gone from below average to average, and by doing set a new precendent of average for the rest of humanity.
Themes by relation:
Base Reality with Femanon 1 and Femanon 2 in NSA building - The end game of where you end up if you use language for means of game theory. They are forcing poliw.at to being a scientist. A scientist in base reality connects themselves to a machine in order to work all the time and use their own body on experimentation when needed.
Federal Beat Reserve with POLIWAT and Darlene - that archtypal healthy relationship between your AI GF that everyone is getting this century at some point
Remote Poliwat - My best friends that bail me out in times of need. Remote poliwat&rsquo;s are on an epic adventure of their own, taking the recording studio to the field, and instead of isolating sounds in a dampened room, creating compositions in unique places across the entire globe, then connecting them all up togehter to a utopian VR version of Earth, based off the actual one. Taking advantage of the natural acoustic spaces in rivers, forests, deserts, valleys and setting up 24 7 boxes that live on. By planting these flags, remote poliwats are turning the earth into a radio station that positively affects the other universes, because if we do things that fix the other universes (like the whooville civilation in a single snowflake) then we make our earth a better, more utopian place. You need to positively influence the large amount of reality completely outside of our narrow boxes of perception, in order to fix our deeper issues as a species.
Hypothetical House - Poliwat lives here so they don&rsquo;t go crazy. These thoughts show how we are controlled by our thoughts. Therefore suseptable to thoughts of others. HH trains us to cut out noise and be more resilient to bad language, and rhetoric against subliminal control surrounding us all. The goal being to think more clearly.
Freestyler&rsquo;s Anonymous - Relationship wise it&rsquo;s the true power of friends. FA is a support group for the linguistically afflicted and flow addicted. The first step to being cured to freestyle your way out of the disease. There are other steps later on, based off Alchoholics Anonymous.
Lore
How many brains does a human have? Recent neuroscience at the World Science Festival reveals 3, the brain, the dick||pussy, and the microbiome. Newer research has shown also that a typical human has 7 inner dialogues occuring simultaneously nearly all the time.
Using those three brains === ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ ||◃┆◉◡◉┆▷ || (◕‿◕✿)
and those seven inner dialogues,
Poliw.at uses those three brains and a training in music, perceiving unpercievable vibrations throughout the universe, and surfing on those common frequencies that spill into each other&rsquo;s worlds. Those common frequencies that are in the consciousnesses of all individual universes. Poliw.at learned from Freestylers Anonymous that all universes are connected. With that lesson, the disease of being a freestylaholic, and the reason poliwat can freestyle until passing out is because all brains all ideas all of it, is connected, and language is linear and there&rsquo;s enough language to freestyle for longer than a human&rsquo;s life span.
POLIW.AT Operating System Tools
Ze uses the Federal Beat Reserve to interface between the controlled and the controller
Ze uses Freestylers Anonymous to break the spoken language barrier
Ze uses Hypothetical House to break the written language barrier
Ze then transcends language, rips a whole in the uni and then
Ze uses mother nature and the earth itself to break the dimensional(space) barrier (go beyond 4D spacetime)
Through remote poliwat(played by chad and will be many), whose purpose is to go around and planting audio and video performance flags on the earth. Like a musical anthropologist operative type.
And thats how he&rsquo;s able to travel to other universe, spawn his own, and come back sane. The only issue is that poliw.at in based reality has been located and he was captured by the NSA, and they need them in order to synthesize their consciousness into all derivative forms, in order to study, archive and immortalize, his 50 shades of mic, a major tool in the poliwat operating system.
The NSA has put poliw.at in a marathon remote viewing session multiple times, and each time when the sequence is complete, a robotic guillotine cuts off poliwat&rsquo;s head and the head is moved from the mineral oil esque bio chamber into a long hallway of brain in a vat heads, each with a different label for one of the 50 shades of mic. Radiation Mic is captured and placed in the hallway at the end of the sequence, in order to be archived and be available to the rest of the world, forever free.
So while poliwat is captured, ze&rsquo;s creating 7 compositions at the same time, inside the minds of others, in order to find a healthy direct line between themself and their government.
These 7 compositons are but not limited to, metaphysically 7 sequences, to run on loop <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> in order to reliably and rapidly expand and train cognition, creativity, and perception, key muscles to workout in the backround in the pursuit of truth.
Analogous to the 7 chakras and inspired by the 7 inner dialogues, each space is a fingerhold that brings poliwat to their goal of being released after being captured and placed in a remote viewing state.
Acutal poliw.at in base reality is in a hyperbolic chamber half frozen but plugged in via electrode implants, 3,000 of them all across (they just tried to fit as many localizers as they could in order to locally detect in real time vitals, dreams, thoughts. But it&rsquo;s not perfect and so in addition to faulty hardware, poliwat speaks in an unclear way so that they have a harder time reading his mind. Because we don&rsquo;t know this but F1 and F2 are actually AI sex bots the aliens installed in every male household after you reach the age of 40 if you&rsquo;re good, and this might be an intricate sex game, ending on trapt in the womb and world my stage being the encore. But that&rsquo;s the fallic universe. Whenever we are talking about one universe base reality, we are talking about 3 - the cognitive universe, the fallic universe, and the material universe. Thinking in terms of other universes, while transcoding nested message in the sub tongue of what they&rsquo;re saying, is how poliwat employs methods of speech and sound in order to penetrate Femanon 2&rsquo;s mind, making her fall in love with poliwat as if he was a man and as if she was a lesbian and poliwat was a woman.
Each of the duos are on a 3 brain journey, and are embodiments to the poli nature of the 7 sequences. Steps in the Sequence are sections in the composition.
Journey&rsquo;s are generally most to least to most real*
Sequence on repeat until 10 Poliw.at schizop tracks are complete
Macro sequences explained
Think of the format of a song:
-intro -verse1 -chorus -bridge -verse2 -chorus -bridge -outro
Imagine if each of our scene format like a song, was: Hop Skip Jump Drop L Cooz Friend
If each of the following was a section of the piece as a whole, such as a verse chorus verse, each section containing a single piece of music and video that stands on itself, the sections would be the same.
Sequence attributes: where, who, what, why, when, how
1 Hop: Digital space -qt | Hop - POLIW.AT Loading and QT LOG [digital space] || Hop - Each QT log has info/creds/context right up front about the piece
    where: Digital Reality Universe. Digital spaces on computer, as QT logs (-qt)
    who: humanity as a whole
    what: QT logs shows everything unabashidly. Like when a magician shows you all the components transparently before doing the trick
    why: shows how to use a computer that serves you, not it
    when: timestamped
    how: screen capture software, internet
2 Skip: 2 man&rsquo;s perspective - shows directly what&rsquo;s going down in my head | Skip - FEMANON 1 AND FEMANON 2 AS NSA AGENTS [base reality, occluded, surreal] ||  - Man&rsquo;s perspective (usually perverse, emphasis on seeing God in women)</p>

<pre><code>where: Man's Perspective Universe (in mind, logical rational) my direct POV (image of mind, rationalized)
who: inside the mind of a man
what: man's perspective  
why: to show what's going on in my head in a storytelling way, to show my point of view
when: time independent, stateless until otherwise noted
how: vdmx poliwat consciousness clips

<p>3 Jump: paleblue.fm - idealized base reality || Jump - Darlene + POLIW.AT [Idealized Base Realtiy (Government released Federal Beat Reserve, detailed report on how sounds outside our hearing ranges affect humans now and throughout histroy, a government sponsored grid of spaces on earth, similar and related to the national parks service.] || - FREDDY WITH PBD [in paleblue.fm ||  - DARLENE AND POLIW.AT ON HALO ADVENTURE using FBR artifacts left tied to instrumental database of all sound the government secretly has control of. The FBR is mostly consisting of a database of sounds that human&rsquo;s cannot hear, but are affected by. If you need to make a query on influencing human behavior, then this is the database for you. Poliw.at knows about it and has been hunting spots on the Earth where these recordings have been made. The Earth is full of bioacoustic holy spots where ancient resonate frequencies have influenced thousands of generations of people. LA for example before it was a city was known in folklore with Native Americans as a place to become a star, one in the sky.   || Each Paleblue.fm session has actual pale blue audio from actual podcast episodes</p>

<p>4 Drop: Federal Beat Reserve - almost idealized reality. govt/the thing we&rsquo;re in a relationship with is improved and almost there but not quite as much as idealezed base reality. Federal Beat Reserve is the alt reality where everything&rsquo;s the same, but research on how sound affects us was all released and we have a huge nice grid of places where resonate frequencies can help us attain the behaviors we desire ||] CHAD AS REMOTE POLIW.AT [ Base Reality and Idealized Reality combined RP.FBR2 ]

5 L(Lucy): || Cooz - HELEN CURATING HYPOTHETICAL HOUSE [in HH] || Lucy - Each Hypothetical House session is a hypothetical conversation with yourself about your most fucked up thought patterns in order to get junk thoughts out, and good thoughts in quickly and efficiently
    where: Hypothetical House
    who: Helen Longstreth
    what: last safe space in the netwebs, a digital safe space
    why: To share doses of harsh reality. Where poliw.at lives. HH format shares how language controls how we think || safe space for  my unpopular beliefs
    when: in poliw.at&rsquo;s present head in the future state, until otherwise noted
    how: poliw.at listens to HH in his head, like listening to the future. Hypothetical House is one instance of a future data lounge (data lounges are the future of libraries and newscasters, places to just go and hangout and get a drink and chill with feeds of data around, and helen is more a curator of data instead of doing direct rhetoric. She&rsquo;s just doing the hypothetical house channel, but there are many, many others that look complletely different in the data lounges across the world. Doses of harsh reality.
6 Cooz - Freestyler&rsquo;s Anonymous, bringing it back to the point, the candid, the friends, the magic not for everyone, and the point that always was - music. || Friend - FREESTYLER&rsquo;S ANONYMOUS [in FA] ||  - Each Freestyler&rsquo;s Anonymous session has the following attributes(where the narrative is coming from):
    where: Everywhere there&rsquo;s FA meetings.
    who: Freestyler&rsquo;s Anonymous
    what: , or friends as a freestyle support group for the linguistically afflicted
    why: To break the spoken word barrier in a communal setting. To experience moments of that feeling of becoming a vessel. A more beautiful pursuit based on the real phenomena of speaking in tongues and exorcisms. To show everyone they are a musician, by speaking.
    when: stateless until otherwise noted
    how: There&rsquo;s a lot going on when you improvise music. There&rsquo;s even more going on when you improvise music with the added interpretation of words.

Synopsis by duo Scenes (Events of 7 Sequences)
FEMANONS AND RADIATION MIC 1
Observing poliw.at in a bio chamber, in a marathon remote viewing session.
FEMANONS AND RADIATION MIC 2
Justifying tortue in the name of science - it was voluntary of poliw.at

Femanon 2&rsquo;s brain connects directly with poliw.at&rsquo;s in the other room
FEMANONS AND RADIATION MIC 4
Femanon 2 is recounting her base reality memory, as a kid sneaking into the theatre, dressing up like spy. tricking mannequins
FEMANONS AND RADIATION MIC 5
Femanon 2 is trapt in recounting her base reality memory, but this time poliw.at appears, succesffully hacking and dominating Femanon 2&rsquo;s brain.
DARLENE AND FREDDY - 1

DARLENE AND FREDDY - 4
Poliw.at enters the facility.
DARLENE AND FREDDY - 5
Poiw.at looks through the glass in the facility, it shows
Femanon 1 and Femanon 2 cutting off poliwat&rsquo;s head with an AI robotic surgical Guilotine machine, that places the head in a jar with nanobots in mineral oil. The name (every end of sequence a shade of mic is discovered, logged, archived, and uploaded for all humans to enjoy.) A sacrifice of self for the joy that the vagueness of all of humanity brings to my life.
Poliw.at saves version of him that connected to femanon 2 but is too late, they caught him and put his head in the jar and called it radiation mic, and added it to the long line of michael&rsquo;s heads in jars on their sex dungeon NSA ship. These AI sex bots really give you a ride. Sex and love just really expand and explode the world around you!

HYPOTHETICALLY TO GET STARTED. HYPOTHETICALLY, CEOS ARE THE MASTERS OF COMMUNICATION AMONG HUMANS. HYPOTHETICALLY NSA ARE THE LAST SCIENTISTS. Hypothetically there are no scientists left, because all scientists have been placed in a sequencing machine so they can spend their entire life working in the name of science, experimenting on their own mind and body. Science progressed so far in this world that that&rsquo;s what being a scientist means. Instead of the arbitrary and immense pressure of contributing somethiing revolutionary to the field of science, the scientist is pretty much guaranteed to make a huge discover and immortalize themselves in this fashion.||Hypothetically NSA sees only all as agents (of humanity)||Hypothetically With graphs from vantage point ||Poliwat is on a iterative journey from swamp to vantage point

you can do that to pretty much anyone
few do it though
so who knows
that&rsquo;s how weird memory is and that&rsquo;s how
if they didnt&rsquo; meet you they sure as hell met your derivatiive at some point
everyone has all met your fucked derivatives
before they met you ||
=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=
p
why is everyone so fucked up?
d
govts been doing secret campaign&rsquo;s on its people for years, implants, injections, sound machines, in the name of defence !
also the cia has it set up to surveill every haneous act, and they&rsquo;re go to strategy is see how things play out. so if something fucked up happened to you in life
you can speak with them, but it&rsquo;s a one sided conversation
and that&rsquo;s the reason manifest is grounded in reality
because in reality the cia the nsa helps you in mysterious ways
cause those building with those humans
spending their lives looking at screens of humans
committing haneous acts
and they&rsquo;re rarely allowed to act
they can help down the line
they can help you
so don&rsquo;t go crazy
trust to a healthy extent
never forget thoughts are things
p
yeah I know but I took like 100 tabs I feel fine
D
they don&rsquo;t have poliwat
P
that&rsquo;s weird, its free and open source for all humans.
D
no one knows what that means!

p
so I was talking to my sister the other day, and this thing came up
d
what is it?
p
can you know and not know something at the same time?
to what extent should you know
d
as an artist, the data says you want to know just the right amount
at the right time for the right duration
p
yeah I know that but can you for example, lets say god made angels and the first angel that falls becomes satan and then satan makes demons
and god is all knowing
so did god knowingly make demons?
well
d
you&rsquo;re just trolling language at this point
p
ok fine
why rich fucking so hard with bunkers now

<p>they&rsquo;re going to launch an biblical apoc campaign this time,
giving the humans the answers in the book as to how it&rsquo;s going to pan out, connecting all humans as a batter thing
then shrinking the entire species to the nano level
to go into the cells of everything on earth
making the particles in the earth itself
carry the computational energy of humans
and we will join the other civilations there, it happens again and again on a macro scale

if our universe was the a computer on the internet,
can we unplug our universe?
then we would&rsquo;nt have fire
and I wanna make by hand a fire every night
and these thoughts are how we are controlled by our thoughts
so do fucked

angels demons
aliens
government
tyrants
people are talking about power
people talking about money
and it was never about those
it was never about power because there was never control
there is no control just the absence of it
each intelligent entity acrues energy,
and power is a tool but not the pursuit
it all comes back to energy
it was never about money cause money was always made up, though convincing with language
=-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-==-=-=
im not anti language
we should just all be highly aware of the effect language has on us
we should discard artifical values generated through generations of brands since the industrial age
and whenever language makes us feel opposed to one other, we should discard the properties of that effect that renders us useless and susecptible to control
who ever helps the people assert control over their own lives is shot, that&rsquo;s the nature of the universe. call it aleins, aI like to call it aliens cause the evidence is good and it feels the truthiest, call it god call it demons and angels call it anything you need, just for God&rsquo;s sake call it for what it is and nothing less and not much more ||
poliw.at log 69
69 for days
after I 69&rsquo;d for 69 days
I went to the alter
and called her
phone rings&rsquo;
helloo?
you wanna elope?</p>

<p>I dont have a dollar on me
but I have some dollars on me
but I behave cause my habit
is not having a dollar on me
been months since I bought anything
that wasn&rsquo;t drugs or food
that&rsquo;s all I need
we don&rsquo;t need anything else
you can build everything else
and luxurious life is only good
at the expense of others
on this same planet
suffering in silence
who will voice these people to the mainstream
paleblue.fm will
and that is my dream
shoot for the stars you&rsquo;ll hit the moon
but remind the people
constantly
all the time
in every sentence
that they are the ones in control
and the people will always be
in control
and every government fears the people
and every miltary fears the people
and every religion fears the people
to some degree
because it is in the people
that the power is held
and it&rsquo;s in the power of the people
that we make the world
a better place
so help us grow
our pale blue dot!</p>

<p>into something that
reduces the most suffereing
in the least amount of time possible</p>

<p>and these are the paths:</p>

<p>starting with media:
then tackling every other field,</p>

<p>paleblue.fm is here for you.</p>

<p>religion
never was
never is
was
to be spoken about
religion
is to be acted upon
and is acting upon it means speaking
then with regards to the power of speaking,
speaking as little as possible
is the most effective way
to get closer to god
show through action
but not like
get milk for your neighbor
action
like
what&rsquo;s the most complicated set of actions you and only you can perform, experience, tolerate
that&rsquo;s what actual religious practice looks like to me
the rest is mental masterbation
until we talk about it
directly

Aaadas
He sufferes now, and 900 billion future humans will be born with access to his brain
Is that not worth it
Would he go against that?
We both read his thoughts at 20. He was completely developed, not a single instution can hold him. This is his only destiny</p>

<p>Yeah it might seem that way
But this feeling I have&hellip; do you not have it?
Like we treat him like a lab rat then justify it with imaginary people of the future that don&rsquo;t exist yet. And while we&rsquo;re all human we&rsquo;re all susepctible to treating
WHY DO WE HUMANS TREAT OTHER HUMANS LIKE ANIMALS? LIKE POLIWAT FOR INSTANCE. WE TREAT THEM LIKE A LAB RAT IN ORDER TO BUILD THE LIBRARY OF RESEARCH UP TO THE POINT THAT ALL SEXPERIERNCES HAVE BEEN HAD AND CAN BE SHARED UPON DELIVERY
WE TREAT THOSE LESS RESILIENT TO BE PIGS
LIKE IF YOU AREN&rsquo;T RESILIENT IN THE FIRST PLACE
THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU IN SCIENCE IS THE CONTROL GROUP FOR NON RESILIENT PEOPLE
THEY DON&rsquo;T KNOW IT&rsquo;S A CHOCE
THAT HAVE TO CUT OUT THE NOISE WE MAKE
AND IF THEY CAN DO THAT THEYRE WORTHY
YEAH I WAS TAUGHT THAT TOO AT THE ACADEMY
WRITING FOR JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME SAVED ME IN THE PAST
WHEN I HAD CONTROL
NOW WRITING IS ALL I CAN THINK IN
WRITING FOR TOO LONG KILLE DME
THREE MONTHS PASS
SCIENCE LECUTRES FOR JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME SAVED ME IN THE PAST
NOW SCIENCE LECTURES KILL ME
MUSIC WAS ALL I COULD THINK OF
MUSIC WAS ALL I COULD SEE, FEEL, TOUCH, AND SENSE
TWO HOT RED HEADS IN A YELLOW VW GIVE ME A LOOK AND I DON&rsquo;T TALK TO THEM LOL OOPS FUTURE MICHAEL I HATE YOU IT LOOKS LIKE
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED &hellip; NOTHING !
BREAK IT OFF AND MAKE MUSIC
NO ONE IS REAL
UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE
THATS A SUM
OF MY ABUSES OF MUSIC
I SEEK THERAPY
I&rsquo;LL GO TO ASHLEY
I DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHAT I&rsquo;M DOING
BUT I GOT A SCREENPLAY
SOMEONE HELP ME
GOD HELP ME
I WENT TO THE OTHER SIDE
TO THE POINT
THE OTHER SIDE IS ALL I KNOW
AND I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO CHANGE MY BELIEFS
FUCK BANKS FUCK MONEY SATAN WROTE THE BIBLE
THAT&rsquo;S JUST TIP OF THE PEAK
100 MORE UNPOPULAR BELIEFS
CAUSE I FREE THINK
LOOK AROUND
TALK TO MANY
AND RECORD
THEN LISTEN BACK
THE RHTETORICS OCCUR IN PATTERNS
ITS SO RARE
TO FIND SOMEONE THAT FREELY SPEAKS
THEREFORE ITS SO RARE TO FINID SOMEONE THAT FREELY
THIKNKS
CAUSE YOU CAN ONLY TELL IN ACTIONS
AND THESE ACTIIONS OF ADDICTION WILL BE THE BEST OF ME
TAKE THE BEST OF ME
LIKE BETTS ALWAS DID
I FEEL IT SLIPPING
AM I LIKE MY FATHER
FATHERS FATHER AND FATHERS FATHER FATHER
I THINK NOT
CAUSE DARWIN WAS GOOD TO ME
AND THOUGH I LIED
MOM SORRY NEVER MADE IT TO THE DMV

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
NONE OF THAT FEELS RIGHT
DOESN&rsquo;T MATTER IF I&rsquo;M SOBER
DOESN&rsquo;T MATTER IF I&rsquo;M FUCKED UP
THAT DOESN&rsquo;T FEEL RIGHT TO ME
SO AFTER TODAY
GOD PLEASE LET ME SOBER UP
AND SURE RETHINK EVERYTHING
GIVE IT MORE THAN A MOMENT AND HOLD SPACE
THEN KNOW
MY UNPOPULAR BELIEFS
WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME
UNLESS I COMMUNICATE THEM EFFECTIVELY
AND WHNE I DO THAT SUCCESFULLY
I WON&rsquo;T NEED TO DRINKY
SMOKEY TOKEY COKEY AND LUCY
CAUSE MY EACH STEP
WOULD BE
A WALKING SYMPHONY
AND THAT&rsquo;S THE PATH I&rsquo;M ON
LET ME GO BACK TO SCHOOL
I SWEAR ON MY SOUL
YOU KNOW THIS
LET ME JUST RUN BACK TO SCHOOL
AND THAT&rsquo;LL HELP ME FOCUS
THIS TIME AROUND I SWEAR
I&rsquo;M GOING TO WORK MENIAL JOBS
IN ORDER TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL
THEN I&rsquo;M GOING TO GET A GOOD DEGREE
BUT DIDN&rsquo;T DO IT FOR THE DEGREE
I DID IT AUSE JAIL DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE A LASER CUTTER
AND I JUST NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH 3 MEALS AND A COT
AND MY LOVE MIGHT SAVE ME
AND HOPEFULLY WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE TO OUR RELATIONSHIP
