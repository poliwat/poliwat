 Capo 4 and Cmaj7 to start then you can figure out the rest if you want to play this low hanging fruit just cruzing in the neighborhood just boozing in the neighborhood just losing the neighbors now look good now look good postabout it post about it now look good she doesn&#39;t go outside no mirrors outside this hottie isn&#39;t outside then she ends up in a pile now look cute now look cute post about it now look cute post about it now look cute (breakdown) (verse 3 b) daddy says shutup make no mistakes and get straight As that&#39;s how you were raised but but we combed the streets and we combed the lakes and we combed our hair looking for you your parents are worried you didn&#39;t come home your parents are worried you didn&#39;t come home make no mistakes make no mistakes &amp;gt; just cruzing in the neighborhood just boozing in the neighborhood just losing the neighbors now look good now look good post about it now loo good post about it now look good  </description>
