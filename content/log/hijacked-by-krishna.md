Almost to the laser cutter but hanging with krishna and jana. It's a perfect day.
Hawaiian macadamia coffee.

Alright my logs have sucked dick. I'm not sure why. Since the party I haven't felt like paryting. I just want to work on my shit, though that's a party in a way.  

Am I lonely?

I'm not sure if I'm exhibiting behavior on account of being lonely, or stressed. So it's hard to diagnose.


why is poliwat shitty? because my phone's full


this is a piece of shit track I've spent waaaayyyy too much time on:
