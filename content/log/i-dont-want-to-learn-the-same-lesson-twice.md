**Saturday 822 AM**

Been writing a lot in the vanilla Notes app that comes with OSX.

I got great alien tape of my mom last night

I don't want to learn this same shit, I've gone in a cycle since 21-22 and it's time to identify then break it.
I can't stand the thought of learning these same lessons yet again at 26 or 27.
holy tits this is important.

The Cycle:

consider the following

I want to make art
I want to have a business

^ the point of convergence is that these are both one in the same.

My Stanford radio show will be called the lost tapes, and I can get free tickets to a bunch of shows and record them for the station.... muahahahhaha

Going to Marion's in a second, I haven't been able to focus well since about 11 AM last night! Not good. But sober life is good.

So idk man

I want to laser cut some shit! Bringing my laptop so I can hit a coffee shop by the beach before coming home and getting my Earth designs off the ground.
