My ass is at the chapel. Sagan is playing in the backround.

What can I say? Nick and I went to the Buckminster Fuller 50th anniversy party for his book, $%^&eRTY

and we had a blast. Hung out with his tree crew,

met a cool author Brandon Peele

Met a cool Ecuadorian mentor type guy Joe

Hung out with Nick's tree crew Dustin, Brian, and $%^&

##### THEN

We hit the station and did a live pale blue dawt !

Cripsi mackenzie and E o B called, and Brian called twice. The show went alright, but Nick said I should curate more and I agree.



Got really useful feedback from him on the drive back.

##### LEVEL UP MOMENT FOR SURE

Credit card is officially maxed out and I still haven't gotten my naturalist check.

Not sure how I'm going to pay rent next month, but will go all out on making the PBD website primo as can be.


Going to be revisiting CLASSIFIED LiC today, and
