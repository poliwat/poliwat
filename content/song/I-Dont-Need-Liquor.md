#### Lyrics

```

I don't need liquor when you are me
I do not need liquor when you are the beat
I do not need liquor when I think that I'm in love
I do not need liquor when I believe in God above
I do not need liquor when I need no more sentences
I do not need liquor when I don't need a linguist
I do not need liquid when my actions are intended 
I show you through my actions I love you in this nation
(double time)
I do not need no liquor because you are my liquor
because you on this beat and this beat is getting sicker
and becca on the drums and mike up on them keys
and michael on the bass
that's michael with no liquor, clean

//
(chorus)
please
love me love you love this holy shit
//

```
