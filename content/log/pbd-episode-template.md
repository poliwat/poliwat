KZSU Stanford College Radio

You're listening to the first episode of pale blue dawt

tonight's episode is more of a human collage of sound and music,

all sounds are from my sound library,

with music sprinkled over real people, living real lives,

This is billed as a talk show, however the people speaking are augmented with music
