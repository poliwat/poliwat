other animals bond, but they don't go bananas


don't listen to people when it comes to money


point of the life - a good party

what DNA is trying to do - create what you imagine instantaneously


we addict to each other





secret history of the human race



new part of the human mind


what I learned


If any animal we are inspired by, let us be inspired by the octopi. They have telepathic abilities, a future communication option for humans.


Since being a boy I've always loved the C IA



the universe is not rational or logical
logic is one tool to predict


people abducted my UFOS



our culture sets us up to implicitly bend over for the employer. I am an employer, always.


everyone clicks on clickbait


gaslight your cat


waste chop then write like you're running out of time



when you trip on psilocybin, the trips are influenced our shamanistic ancestors that influenced the drug


invisible permeating something, in all things and its novelty
and novelty is going to end

*thursday 814 pm*

There is only one job in this world.
That is the producer.
Life is not a play, with us as actors.
We construct our own realities,
handpick our casts,
like good working ant producers.

What's the point in all life? A good party.


just moving thoughts
helped laura move all day now I'm moving myself!
will bike to cruzio later to see if brent has loaded the homeless tape ont my premium metal edition external.
