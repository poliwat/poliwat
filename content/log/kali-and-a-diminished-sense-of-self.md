**wed 305 PM**

On micro

why do I always see david dunn when I micro lol


just climbed a tree with becca, and this is how you climb a tree -

you choose a branch that is a one way trip.

a branch that is high enough and long enough that if you climb out of the tree, you can ride it completely, instead of going back

Those are some of my favorite trees to climb, cause you sort of just pass through them versus the more traditional up n down the same way.

   alright fuck journaling just talked to david dunn and confirmed he's down to come record at my house, so now I'm going to prep a little presentation for him

because he's the only person I can be completely transparent with. that's a poor choice of wording, it's more like

He spent a TON of hours on some of the same stuff as me, so when two humans enter a thing like that, where you're building up foundations, they both start right there  

 so when  two humans enter this

So we are going to run through an hour long about us

About us episode 1:

just tone it back 90%

that's when everyone freaks out



also the ritual - the ritual of audio

how was I ignoring this jesus shit.

right now I'm recording some 3 sorrority girls - I'm bumping milo but I think they're talking about stupid shit.

About being a pledge or whatever its called.

OSOD is really just a declaration of a fact.

In any profession or career you find yourself pursuing, even if its being a gypsy transient.

we all die as a planet and as a species
if we continue to have patents
if we continue to  


if we don't open source everything


FUTURE MICHAEL YOU ARE BANNED FROM THESE WORDS

# Fav gem of the day

Aside the from the tree I almost died in

it ended up being not that bad, that's the thing.

the first time you do something, it's so much harder.

then it's cake.

eyes closed
like a jedi
in the midnsummer night heat
eyes closed
like a jedi
in a midnight slump beat
eyes closed
red eye


everything I record will always be free
everything I touch will always be free
that's me
I'm free

freedom
freedom
freedom comes at
a cost
a cost of self

eyes closed
