#### Lyrics

```
I'm not usually the one
to slow it down
but that saddest truth
that gets to you
and I know
that my laptops
missing
screw you

and I miss myself
missing
you but
whats the hardest truth
of myself missing you

like everything ends
or having loose screw

whats the hardest truth
when there's no truth
I'll never be
all I see
but lifes so precious
no one whats they doing
world full of suffering
but that those though
small truths
whats the hardest truth
everything ends
eventually
for us all
I
miss myself missing you


```
