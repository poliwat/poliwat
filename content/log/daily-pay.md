Daily pay went through

Been browsing the net and prepping for the show. I've gotta get more organized.

```
Clean up Audio


prompt anyone to call and leave a voicemail for my show (say whatever you want)

define scheduling process

reach out to eco companies

write cold email template for show

make all accounts

```

figure out workflow for show

where do I write sketch ideas?

where do I organize the show?

Segments
  voicemail wisdom

I love working in atom, maybe just have a hugo dev site for the workflow of everything

tape has a goal
tape has a goal now
tape has a game

tape is scheduled
tape is rancid
