**Tuesdat 741 AM**

With v few exceptions, I've been living the past few weeks only talking with the people that come right up to me in person. I would recommend doing this occassionally - yesterday I hit a new calm while sanding and painting some wood I found in the backyard.

I love working with wood, I could do that all day sober as a bird. The lucy makes it better though.

I bumped Cosby best of on the vinyl and it was hilarious.

I'm starting to feel bad about not responding to some people, though.

Today is all about more wood prep, and other creative projects.

I think I should get poliw.at online again.
