#### NARRATOR
Cause one time he had a hard drive, and knew I was into computers.

So I had to fix the port and transfer everything to the new drive he gave me. Found this weird script that's hilarious, check it out...

Characters:

  - CLOUD BITCH
  - FAMOUS ANUS
  - NARRATOR
  - RICH FAT PRINCE

# Cloud Bitch and Famous Anus Adventures #1

#### RICH FAT PRINCE
Oh how's it going man, I haven't seen you since high school!

CUT TO 3 minutes later...

(Both laughing)

#### RICH FAT PRINCE
Do you remember Cloud Bitch and Famous Anus?

# and when they...

<!-- And you upload this video
and it tells you where it was shot,
by  computer vision   -->


##### FAMOUS ANUS
EW

##### CLOUD BITCH
Don't schedule anything with me unless you want to get hurt.

##### FAMOUS ANUS
Gross.

##### RICH FAT PRINCE
(video goes to all four seasons over the course of this)

But let me be your kind of boyfriend.

The kind of boyfriend that you wanna bring home.

The kind of boyfriend that always eats the end of his steaks, with his bare hands.

The kind of boyfriend that's writing a love story, about two NPCs.

The kind of boyfriend that adds magic to your world.

The kind of boyfriend that when he sings, sounds like a time capsule bursting open line after line!

The kind of boyfriend that always uses wires over bluetooth

The kind of boyfriend that haunts ghosts

The kind of boyfriend thats too low brow to be pretentious

The kind of boyfriend that's always meeting someone new

The kind of boyfriend that opens anything with a lighter

The kind of boyfriend that has a 6 year old child inside them that takes over

The kind of boyfriend that sees smartphones as leashes.

The kind of boyfriend that would walk any amount of miles for a cup of free coffee or wine.

The kind of boyfriend that thinks you needn't drive if it's under two miles.

The kind of boyfriend that stands in line at catholic food handouts with the homeless.

I aim to be the kind of boyfriend, that stays,
and lays in roots of love and grows on change!

That's the kind of boyfriend that I aim to be. I love you, helen.


#### NARRATOR
That was the end of the script on the hard drive. So I rewrote it:

## Famous Anus and Cloud Bitch

#### FAMOUS ANUS
You got clout?

#### CLOUD BITCH


#### not below this line you know the drill

___

```
Dear son,
your child's destiny
to take it for granted
the life you gift them
```

# Lessons from Neverland

- Never tell someone to workout while they're working out.

- Never open a beer with a lighter in front of your girl's mom.

- Never talk about prices. If I want to know the price I'll ask.


#### Shower Thoughts

- Send collages of remixed NYTIMES back to them from the previous week

- Book title 'evading pricetag' or something dumb like 'Transcending price (Â¡tag!)'

- And the medics were ashamed at the 'conspiracy theories' cause the bad ones that exist hard are leveraged to help discredit the good.

GAL S OVER GOALS LULL !!

Make something so hard
it becomes a genre

Life through a bicycle

seeing people that don't look real
and only few know
Bots are here already
they take over weak minds

So biking through the city  
there isn't much of anything
without a witness
