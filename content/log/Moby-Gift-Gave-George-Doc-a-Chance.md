#### chords/lyrics

```

(Am Dm  E G)


Dm           G
It’s a little late for honey wine
C - E - Am
but the voids our bullseye
E                E7
even the pine doesn’t mind

Am            Dm       C    E          F      C                  E7
my gifts bring harm to me, Like fruit trees, packed till picked, ripe till ripped,

Dm         G                  C - E  -  Am
mountain top be the mountain pine that resides,

Dm     G
sick all day

C —  E - Am
you are wizard of your own life

F     Cmaj7                      G7     
be the mountain itself, not the pine



Am            Dm       C         E                F   C          E7
but even the pine doesn't mind, it grows all the time without mind

Dm           G            C
it thinks left wait or right


Am            Dm       C         E                F   C          E7
mountain top the mountain pine resides, be the mountain itself, not the pine


Em               A7
don't worry of monuments in your name
Em               A7   B7
it's all you just the same


Dm               G
It’s a little late for honey wine

C  -  E —  Am
but we’re aiming for the void

F                 G
where the sky and wave

could each be one and the same
hold it right side up
ocean looks like sky
hold it upside down
sky looks like ocean   
waves and sky aiming for the void

```
