Window shopping while looking for love

I don't know I have to just keep reading.. I have to have my top tens in physical form immediately. There is nothing but my music. The rest is noise.
Women, men, politics, news, addiction, apocalypse...it's all noise. Beethoven's letters are rubbing off on me. He's not a natural writer, just like me. But those 10- tens I criticized for years have become so important to me.

Something you can keep revisitng and it gets better and better .

Or desert island, hath would be something as well.

Your deserts not getting any dryer

Global village

# propaganda that increases empathy

The moment she crossed over the bridge, RIP, your majesty
