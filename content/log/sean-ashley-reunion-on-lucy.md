**Fridat 5:36 PM**

**Friday 555 PM**

I got the speaker so i'm sitting pretty

today is the day I catch up on poliw.at

no more excuses

I hate that I can justify everything

it's so easy to trick myself

and yet so hard

        =-=-=-=-=


  like how am I feeling ?

  no I just need to talk

  writing is too linear right now

  I'm tired of lines

  already laid

  I redraw the lines

  to give precedent

  to what doesn't

  my journal is on the big screen I just realized

  and everyone can see

  and my piano is playing in the notes

  ```
  Im not talking looks
  Im talking looks like
  I'll need 50 bucks for this piece of art
  please
  something someone coughs
  is something I'd slit a throat guarantee
  ```
