**Tuesday 1009 AM**

On a balcony with outlets so I'm pumped. Worked on avery's site till around 4 and now about to make changes in Omari. I have a redbull I'm about to pop! Charging the Go Pro. I broke so many audio laws this past week, I don't even know what to do with myself. At this point in time I have lost about 3 micro sd cards which has all the best tape from the last 1-2 weeks. I should kill myself, but instead I'll enter a ten day hackathon for a real release of Paleblue dot on Earth Day.

How do you get me to accomplish something? Have me tell a pretty girl whats being delivered, and then deliver it.

Wrong side of the platform cause I was on the phone with you
