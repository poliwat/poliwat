Inspiration at the end of this life, if life was a chapter without a book.

**9:09AM**

@Columbia computer lab, going to work hard on uploading more music, and applying to positions here. We have a flight booked on the 28th to head to Chicago now- going to spend two weeks there.

Like in Moby Dick, when he climbed up the chimney as a boy, his stepmother sent him to bed for the rest of the night - it was 2 PM.

I'm still waking up, just sipping the first cup of americano becca bought me. I have a giftcard for sweetgreen for lunch, I'll hit that at around 12:15 when she goes to therapy. So it's important to just bump out the work while I have a moment to myself in a quiet space.

Did I already write this? That time a couple weeks ago when I was being an extra in Chloe's film (don't know her) with Becca, Helen, and JPS - when some dude said I looked familiar and asked if I went to Yale. I said no but I'm my mind I said no, I'm homeless! But what went from having 6 weeks to make 500 for rent now is tentatively going to be 10 weeks. So I can spend the next 8 days really working on applications for more skilled positions in the city.


#### From _Liber Primus_

```
A Cicadian is someone who has chosen to give up the superficial and unfulfilling world around them to follow the path of the Cicada, and emerge into enlightenment….

Enlightenment to a Cicadian is a state in which we are wholly optimized and present as a portion of the Global Consciousness. To be in this state, we must exercise our minds, our Will, our bodies, and our intelligence.

This doesn’t mean to give ourselves over to something else. Instead it is to become one with our true nature: as a part of the Global Brain.

In the Liber Primus, 3301 left us four sets of instructions (possibly more that have yet to be discovered). Over time, we will provide an analysis of these instructions and the far-reaching implications therein:

Command your own self.
Do four unreasonable things each day.
Program your mind.
Program reality.
Question all things.
Discover truth inside yourself.
Follow your truth.
Impose nothing on others.

```

**11:13**

Relocated to the S&E Library, there's a great table I LOVE. Becca's getting out at noon I believe, and I'll smoke and take a lunch break and then hit it back here again. Putting together a list of works and it's kind of a lot so far.

```
ill be out on the streets
cause I’m not on the lease
if I feel making beats
if I keep rapping these
homeless a year
now she signed a lease
won’t suck my dick
till I pay for new sheets
looking for work
biggest bitch I ever had
making tunes never made my dad
a cent
so all that karma built up
I’ll make it with this song
fuck the house
its a compound   
```
