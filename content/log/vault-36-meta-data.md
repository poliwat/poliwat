Title
Vault 36 S1 Video Clips from POLIW.AT

Description:
Vault 36 is an open source video library created by mixed media artist Poliw.at and used often by the nonprofit Paleblue.fm .

Poliwat - I use these clips for music videos, live visuals, secret kickbacks, and other projects.

If you found any of this footage useful, feel free to shout out @poliwat , or send me love through donations through one of my sites.

Open source or die!
