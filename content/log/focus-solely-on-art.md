*Wed 505 PM*

First day back in Santa Cruz. It's been a hard one. Stefan and I woke up in Trong's studio, and he gave us a ride all the way from San Jose to our house here. It was very kind. But I had too bad dreams about my ex that I don't want to get into. Also she asked if she could live with Stefan when he posted that he's looking for a new roommate. Her creepiness is at an all time high and only time will heal my built resentment towards her.


Joined an Transhumanist /  Antinatalist group on Discord per Tyler's recommendation. Don't tell them I'm not an antinatalist but I am a Transhumanist. So far they're getting in a fight over a youtube comment. Someone is about to get booted. Not interesting so far.

It's important always be reading. But with work reading becomes a luxury. I read some of my housemate's book after he helped me pick up some conga's from my dad's place.


My left ankle is killing me. Also talked to my boss about not working on the corporate sites anymore, I can't do it. I'm officially transitioning away, and will work the next week to train this other guy. When I told him about my music ventures, he basically looked at me like I was crazy.
