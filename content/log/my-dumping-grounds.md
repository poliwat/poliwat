*Wed 811PM*

Philip Wadler is here talking about Haskell. I ate too many mushrooms and tried to piss in an empty starbucks cup while stefan and I drove through the city, but he hit a speed bump and I got piss all over myself. I'm wearing his clothes :)


This poliwat shit is really my dumping grounds. It's the one space where I can unleash everything. Other social media sites suck a phat chode. I want to share but not have to worry about what others think. this is my space for that. we all have a space for that, somewhere.

tasklist for michaelbetts dot me

  - make hover over icons a heart not > thing
  - add the innovators podcast
  - make background more spacey


  gotta keep it short and sweet, I really went into the weeds today churning out [this site](https://innovatorsrad.io/)

  .... am I going sailing tomorrow? I shouldn't but I sure hope so.

Started on 2 tracks in maschine based off this tape. I like the idea of moving around a repetitive note. Stefan and Danny came over and I started writing lyrics for Stefan's latest track, which I pursued the same idea, only lyrically:

```
I'm looking for humanity through a laptop screen

is it my escape

through all the haze

you owe it to
you owe it only to yourself

in my mind all the time

when you feel []

you wont []


I wanna
hideout in my house
buy my dreams
in a vending machine

outa this atmosphere

space station

I'm looking

high and below

I'm looking High

I'm looking High
and below

Capture your essence from behind a screen
only good tv is for dopamine
they mastered it

the truth
we all end up worm's food

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

gemini

two things in my mind

I'm looking
I'm hard
hard pressed to find
someone who does what they love 24/7
no obstruction

play it

play

think of life like a play

play it to

heart and soul

but the mud has consumed me with fear


I

I

I live my own life

I

I live my own life

I'm hard

I

I miss myself missing you

I love myself

I float above all the bullshit you spraying
from another blogger asshole on the street

sunshine on the opacity

I

I miss myself missing you

I

I am strong
that my sayance

I am the only one

that has to live with I

I

I

I

I am fed

I am fed up

I am fed

I am fed up with the feeds selling me my next thought

algorithms that train the patterns of

I am fed up with humans excuses for not getting anything done

I am fed up with people not living the way they like
Abstract they problems away to traffic

I am fed

I am fed up with abstracted thought

I am fed up with how we can justify we the ones not doing the damage done

I am fed up with how we can justify we aint the ones holding the gun

I am fed up with my mind

change my mind all the time

great minds think alike

great minds fuck sometimes

this beat makes me wanna ask if you wanna dance I wanna dance I wanna dance with great minds

I wanna make a better world

I wanna make a better BLT

I wanna understand this monkey beat

I wanna express love in new ways

I wanna make sense of the world apocaplypse they left us WITH

they left us

full of sin  

media out for cigs

underhugged underloved
I'm overhugged over worked
I think I might

breakout in breakdance on bart next time I get high

show someone


```






#### also brain dump never rap this outloud
```

call your bitch
call my dick
call your shit dick bitch my dick
that's all they rap these days

```
