#### Poem a day keeps cancer in the bay

```

|| love as capital
|| peace as hate
|| therapy as escape
|| trap as disease
|| life as short
|| power as poison
|| knowledge as disease
|| therapy as escape
|| homogenization as disease
|| Books as monopods
|| Looks as distraction
|| Blindness as sight
|| Fortune as plight
|| Scribbles as scripture

|| Rich as poor
|| Scribbles as scripture

|| eat oysters eat pussy
|| be careful don’t get addicted to either
|| faith without trust
|| god without belief

|| Gods greatest creation
|| Satan’s greatest creation
|| Man’s greatest creation
|| Woman’s greatest creation
|| Human’s greatest creation
