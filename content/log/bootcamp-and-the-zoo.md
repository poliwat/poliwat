*111 PM*

It's a hard day


##### But

Jack and I hit Bootcamp at 930 and it was a gnarly workout. Ate well and been trying to remove a virus from my lappy.
Going to get a haircut, then go to Stanford but I may not at this point because this virus shit is taking too long. I'll work on music, the track to be released this Friday.  

I haven't seen Jack wash a single dish since living here



Hello,

We are putting on a comedy play based off the video game franchise The Sims, and are scheduling auditions for a few roles.  Below is the description of the roles, if any of your students may be interested please let them know!

Thanks,
