I'm disappointed in my actions this whole month of may. fuck the month of may. AK and I broke up last may and I still have some emotions. Why would someone give up? What's the point, idk I'm too intense. I lack substance. I lack maturity. I have many caveats. But when I love someone, I'm in it. and she left that. Pretty blaze to give up like that. she won't get more than the time from me until I get over my shit.
