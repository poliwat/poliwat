Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, owners of the Hitching Post Wedding
Chapel, who had enthusiastically offered their services to all comers for decades,
prepared to test the local nondiscrimination ordinance by reincorporating
earlier this fall to add religious themes and purposes to their business
charter. They sued the city preemptively once the federal courts had confirmed
that Idaho’s ban on marriage for same-sex couples was
unconstitutional

Hippocrates of Cos is the father of medicine. He is still remembered 2,500 years later for the Hippocratic Oath (a modified form of which is still here and there taken by medical students upon their gradua- tion). But he is chiefly celebrated because of his efforts to bring medicine out of the pall of superstition and into the light of science. In a typical passage Hippocrates wrote: 'Men think epilepsy divine, merely because they do not understand it. But if they called everything divine which they do not understand, why, there would be no end of divine things.'

Cat is out of the bag
I'm out of the kitchen

microwaved a quesidilla

Hear the situation

Katie drove me home
and we had a meeting
about a dance piece all about the feminine feeling
I'm so lucky to be a part of
such a piece
I'm drinking sake by the coozi at my place

holy mother of God why
do I always want to dietjust saw a lizard
and love this space
I challenge myself to endless ways

catchup on poliwat and submit to reason
fulfill my goals or submit to treason
there's always a new way to spend a season
I lucky I guess cause there's a beach situation
this weekend with a cutie deli
we'll hit the beach cliffes sea and hit a BBQ
@stefans and dani's we will smell
fried zuchini up on the grill

that's done enough said
I'm not rapping anymore until I dead
Last night's show was the worst of the worst
though my rapping is not that according to most
moist is the worst word in the wikictionary
absurd what I use to describe my smelly
breath like dragon bong on the table
chemical habits got me dried out
I need to work not let my dreams spoil
pro bono medicaid I got coconut oil  


help help help help help help help
this isn't copy past this is help help help

cause through the sewage and waist of my mind
it''s always worth diving down depths at a time
cause up come gems and those I shine
outward bound to those around
and that's all I'm reminded of on constant ocassion
relationships drive my voice to reason
and convince to masses that all need see change
as constant don't get lost in your ways

Am I a guise or a disgrace?
who throw stones at me without a trace
my mind is my guise and I
truly wish to die
by insertion execution treason or flight
one of the reasons I wanna be a pilot mike
