Wed 256 PM

Took another sick day. I only care about one thing. Releasing tracks. Today I'm going to completely launch the center of github, and link it to patreon and see if I can get any bites.

Here's the list of TODODODODODODOOS for getting the mvp milestone penis up.

```

1. hunt down bounce stems for each one, make repos for each track
2. finish site
3. deploy site @ github.center


```
