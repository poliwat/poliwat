#### Lyrics

```
(Am Dm  E F)

Am             Dm      C        E     F      
my gifts bring harm to me, like fruit trees,

C                 E7
packed till picked, ripe till ripped,

Dm         G                      C  - E-Am
mountain top be the mountain pine that resides,

Dm     G
sick all day

C —  E - Am
you are wizard of your damn own life

Am   D(D7)
     meanwhile…

 Am            Dm      C        E     F     
my gifts bring harm to me, like fruit trees,

C                 E7
packed till picked, ripe till ripped,

Dm           G
It’s a little late for honey wine

C    - E    - Am
when God’s in the shadow of the pine

Dm     G
walk all day

C —  E - Am
you are wizard of your damn own life

E       E7
Rise please RISE!!!

```

man grew long before came mind

C  -  E —  Am

=========
C  -  E —  Am
lying in the mountain pines

C  -  E —  Am
but we’re aiming for the void

E                A7
even the pine doesn’t mind

the mountain grow without mind

it grows left wait or right

( Am Dm )

Dm               G

Am            Dm       C         E                F   C          E7
but even the pine doesn't mind, it grows all the time without mind
Dm           G            C-
it thinks left wait or right

C - E - Am            Dm       C         E                F   C          E7
mountain pine resides, be the mountain itself, not the pine

be the mountain itself, not the pine
