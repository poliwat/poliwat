I'm getting stuck on Ashley's Photography work. I can't look away! If she had a genre of photos I would call it sexy magic. She exploits the setting around these people to look much more attractive and magical than they're probably treated. The hopeless romantic in me says the magic and beauty are already there, while she uses photography to show and remind others of it.

##### Future tracks will have track art from Ashley and will be notated as such.


Still pretty sick
Mucinex type beat someday, I've been on that dose for like 4 days now
