Spent pouring on a collage. Nice sex to the sound of rain with Helcat. Becca made a yellow cake, painted last night, made a collage and now writing LaC, then going to do some video editing.
The collage was about a lot of things, but one in particular is showing the generation after generation of poor religious hard work of minorities allowed culminated in the ultimate lesson - a Snob learned how to Love.

In cities thereâ€™s lots of girls with edgy hair yet flat as a flatline.
