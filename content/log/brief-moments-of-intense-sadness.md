**thursday 500 pm**

Showed this random guy Curtis my music on the train.

I don't know if I did it to show him my music or to write I did so.

I don't know if I should throw away choosing such separation lines at that definition.

I feel dehydrated and should probably get some water instead of more coffee..

I love the train and every ride on it.

Acid teaches the perspective of the ride, or when a human comes to find themselves out of control as to where exactly they are headed.

DMT teaches you any forms of God you can and cannot imagine, and their constituants, provide a sense of deeper meaning to the degree of what exactly is going on outside of our perceptions and what we term as out of this universe.

I have no cluse but if everything is vibrating, the thought is that humans can change that. Or at least consciousness is powerful enough to change a large degree of bodily functions, in order to heal spiritually physically, and mentally.

**damn 650 PM**

 - damn who knew I would get this out -

```
do I love the states
or do I hate the states
or what do I choose in this moment
```



I'm not afraid,

I'm not discouraged,

I'm disorganized.

Now its all about getting organized.

like what do I want to do

release 4 albums
launch 50 videos on channel

 ok cool so I can go go get that going.

 first the instrumental albums should be polished off, and I could basically get that done almost by the end of the trip, so that's going to be the focus

 the other focus would be to launch up poliw.at

 and update my website with all audio so I can apply to grad programs.

 also a letter of who I am would be great, or a video of it. Either way ust need to focus on finishing the albums - that I'll do now.
