Well yeah that&rsquo;s probably right, but you have more time to develop your interests.

Never drank in a whole foods
so its fitting first time you get drunk then tpy 200 words
a minute it feels plans out the window
80 words a minute it is
but feels 200 plus 3 tips
and an open card means I&rsquo;m leaving happy
and my money isn&rsquo;t anything
doesn&rsquo;t meant anything
is nothing
in the land of the rich
and the free
until dont&rsquo; have any
