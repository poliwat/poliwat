# The magical evocation of words

That's been me, my interests lately. I'm disapointed in myself, and my friends - but that's a small drop in the ocean of our lives, our visit after 2 years back in good old SF. Seeing the beach, the Y, the nicest starbucks, and a great Deli all short beautiful walks away from Matt's place with no kitchen, it really makes me wonder how he can be an alcoholic in suck a place.

Yesterday was a goodbye day - woke up at 8 after being awake most the night feeling an intense headache and way too high and drunk to even play zelda. I managed to get Epona to the castle but couldn't attack.

Not a good nurse, but it was the first night we didn't have to take care of matt so I got a little too loose.

We got him in the shower and we fed him and cleaned his apartment 3 times now, and he barely thanked us and his only claim to fame is that he has a real job now and shit -

Out of all the Peros, everyone is doing well and better except Matt and Jack. Jack's glued to his phone    


you're not allowed to say this because

open

Open Casket for my funeral

haven't written in a while

one day this won't break

one day

somedays the voices dim

and every friend full of action

AOC loving hate

divide by race

bought the jumper new

just to feel like a rate in a maze

Im amazed

at ever lyric you ever heard

was satanic in every way

top 40 controlled by da who

top 40 not decided by you

top 1 big ad

nothing breaks through

she breaking glass ceiling

before it got big

trapt in the womb

before my first hit

5 albums down and 10 unrecorded

4 un mixed

and 5 made up on the spot

hit me in the back of the face

cause your paycheck's been erased

illusion of the 401 K



open the gates

flood the cave

vast under ground base   

now that I lived 5 feet under

but she couldn't get me on bass

rocking sandal and a shoe

for days

staying at a lame ass Frat

intellectual pale horse no act

understand everything you undermine everything


cold start to a warm day

threw up on the ecalyptus leaves

then slept on the beach

by the golden gate

dogs calling lawyers

girls calling lovers

its a writers retreat

if you're not in bed with a write

where do you sleep

prolly on your feet

vitamin I to scrape through your shift

to buy cancerous food and some name brand clit

you wear like a dick


ONE DAY I'LL WRITE DAILY AGAIN, JUST 1 DAY!

WILL IT START TODAY? WE JUST MADE PLANS AND THE ROAD TRIP IS PRETTY MUCH ETHCED OUT FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. IM'M A BIG FAN OF TRAVELLING, BUT GOD DAMN I WISH I DIDN'T EVEN BRING MY EQUIPMENT to make music with the peros cause they're retarded so far.... But santa fe baby! H booked a 5 night stay in a uiet place in the middle of nowhere, so I'm going to be real glad to get it goind. Hiking and recording. and the list of songs I'll run through are in the songbinder.

But this would be a better time to record the past - what has happened in the past,.......ummmm
