Saturday 414 AM

I learned a sure of a hell of a lot about the Betts family


Tommy Betts mentored my dad in guitar. Another relative said he came over to Tommy's house one day and said to him at the door
"Do you drink?" "Do you fuck?".

glazed doughnut



Saturday 822 AM

Heading to The Betts Family reunion!


This place has been so inspirational, I put off all other projects to instead create a little Michigan EP. All the sounds recorded are here in and around Marquette.

It's called Marwuettiqutics
Don't have much to write I've been so busy working on these tracks for the new project for the week.

*This album includes a collection of songs, stories and recordings all captured and produced in and around Marquette Michigan*

Context is key, and some recordings have little explanation tracks inbetween. You can view the album with explanations or without.


Track list:

1. Home of the Pastie (intro spoken word over glazed doughnut)



this song is dedicated to the wise elder
life is a sacred cricle
we dance to pray
we pray to heal
we heal to live
we live to dance

life is a sacred circle
