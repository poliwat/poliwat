There's this girl on the train.
She has a nice SLR camera. For the past hour She's been sneaking photos of people in the lounge car. She might've even gotten me, but I'm not sure.

I got her though

this was recorded on the sixth floor of a stairwell at my uni dorms. I was messing with a made-up, by ear tuning. I don't know what key this is. I'm tone deaf. But I tuned each string by ear, and it sounds like a sort of open tuning.

```
I am lost but I have found
but it's not what I lost

and every grump has been a child
every drunk has been a child
every girl has been a child
I know I've been one hun hunnnn

and every lesson learned soon to be forgotten

I say there's hope
in the way
she looks she looks at his face
there is hope there is hope there is hope

and every moment

```
