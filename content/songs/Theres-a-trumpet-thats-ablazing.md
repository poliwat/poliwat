#### Lyrics:

```
there’s a trumpet this a blazing

and its calling out m name last night

but I don’t remember it last night

but it was something about my brother

and something about my lover

both related somehow

realize, realize

there’s pain in the oh oh ohoha ocean
pain in the oh oh ohoha ocean

just winding up an escher staircase
that’s totally infinite
and I know that you are
feeling kinda frustrated
and I know that you got some time
I got some time to sometime some time to sometime to
sometimes I got
sometime I got too much time to think
sometime I got too much time to think
sometimes

I been meeting your exes

checking they yz s

feeling
```
