Why do I record?

There's a few reasons.



In a composer's mindset, everything is an instrument. Humans are instruments

and I like getting them to sing, open up

I like the process of lightening people's souls.

Hey what's up I'm Michael Betts

Welcome to my website!! It's my website welcome to it.

long story short,

life is short

I have a brain disease

where I always want to kill myself

so everything I make

for the rest of my life

is free

and open source

and this is the home base for a few projects I'm working on with awesome people

and we're all about this human first approach,

Because it isn't until we understand our biology is how we come to terms with our humanity.

I love you
