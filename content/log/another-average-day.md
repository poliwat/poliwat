#### "knowledge, in the cloud, in a tree, in the cloud" - Mr. Smith

Been making wires, figuring out the breadboard setup, and working with just the teensy 3.6 for poliwat. Sampled peter playing the desk and now I want to make a quick little midi controller with the teensy so that we can play the desk kit :)
Going to coffee and do confucious canoes for a 10 minute break.
