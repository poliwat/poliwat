**Wed 227 PM**

Well in doubt
figure it out

with breadth and mind



**wed 3pm**

you've got money
say paypal email chain
I gotta crush
say moon mike today


```
mirror on the legs
mirror on the slit when I get with it
drunk off her ways
quit smoking just to get it
but now Im yelling so ruined it                            |{withdraw all}  
withdrawals I'm feeling it
Safeway I'm stealing it
```


a trend
more thought, less feeling
the balance between thought and feeling
go go heavy on thought heavy on feeling


just dropped my phone again

it doesn't work anyways so fuck it right


launch off lyrics
```
every therepist need a therpist

```



my mom will never stop saying fucked up shit to me

and I love her anyways


**thursday 215 PM**
