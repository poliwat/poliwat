<!-- In Broad terms, Paleblue.fm works to produce creative tech projects to document and pursue truth and document among civilizations, cultures, and peoples, to promote positive adaptation practices. Given the dramatic developments in technological changes, to increase empathy. The first project is a podcast that sounds kind of like life, the musical. It's a podcast that gives voice to every human across the social hierarchy, and finds the connections between our differences.

- By documenting and producing people that would otherwise not be recorded, we start a dialogue for their situation in an artistic way. Historically, sparking dialogue is a definitive method for increasing the quality of lives of the people whom the dialogue is about.</div>

TLDR:
This place is primarily my safe space, a brain dump. I write stream of consciousness, and rarely edit.
Here you can find lyrics for days, projects of various mediums, songs to listen or perform yourself, visuals, stories, screenplays, philosophy, meta advice, poetry, games, jokes, good links, bad links, secrets, and secret adventures. All my art and brain is free for all humans, cause we should all do that, and that's the kind of world I want to live in. And please reach out because I'm committed to this idea and struggle often. I have no residence currently but if you provide one to work fulltime on tech art projects for humanity as a hole, I'm your angel.

##### Anything that looks like this is lyrics:

```
(hook)
Genocide patents
not people  
```

## Intro P <a name="introduction"></a>

### Bio <a name="bio"></a>

I'm poliwat, born and raised in the small town Nipomo, San Luis Obispo county. Both my parents were musicians, and I learned much about music from them. My dad worked in Owen's Music, would repair stringed instruments, and would give lessons for periods of time.

After transferring from community college to Santa Cruz, I got accepted as a Music major but immediately switched into Cognitive Science and talked my way into working as a research assistant in a perception lab. I didn't have the brain for that, or for computer science courses but I love both of those subjects. They just come out in my art.

I've tried many times not being a songwriter, and got real interested in a lot of other stuff over the years.
Musically favorite artists are Regina Spektor, Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd, and Beethoven. Hiphop wise it's Milo, Kanye West, and Kendrick Lamar. I've been putting blood sweat and tears into this site for about 3 years now, and you can checkout the previous versions here
      - https://alpha.poliw.at

      - https://gamma.poliw.at

My life completely changed after doing an extracurricular recording session for a project called rethinking natural history, two friends from college Xochtil and Stefan, endorsed by  two mentors David Dunn and Michael Chemers.

I wanted to free my mind of industry institutions religions sciences and philosophy. So I spent a few years obsessed with making my own religion that works for me, and if you have the Cognitive independence, it's a much nicer way to live. Since you are the primary source of the scriptures, the fear and doubt behind the words is less inflated, and you're less prone to fear your beliefs. I'm not actually sure though.  

## beliefs <a name="beliefs"></a>
> <sub>How would you describe yourself?</sub>

```
seasons in belief
your belief changes with seasons
```

A handful of my unpopular beliefs are: A belief if has any merit standing the test of time needs has to have the capacity to explained as a philosophy, and I like to think of philosophy in this context as something you can die by. Otherwise it's not your philosophy, you don't know. So TLDR; utopia is here on Earth but we have the capacity to do so. I think money is the root of all evil. I think slavery in general has gotten better, but worse in aspects as it's been abstracted away. I think politicians should be those whose personality temperaments have the least interest in power over other people.

I don't have strong beliefs on the subject but wonder, hypothetically if AI already ate us, it's hard to tell at times. I think you should recycle your bluetooth headphones. I think there are a lot of frequencies outside of our hearing range that affect how humans behave. I love the states, and I hate that words of freedom are abused commonly to enslave. I think some of the smartest richest sociopathic humans on Earth treat others like pigs, and that's not good for either party in the long run. I think if we are to survive.

I think you can leverage all your negative emotions and feelings into beautiful actions, and that's an art in itself. I don't think humans are generally evil, or good. All have both capacities in themselves, and the best ones understand the evil capacities inside their minds. I think gambling is used to enslave, I think debt is used to enslave, I think identity politics as a field of study institutionally is half written by those who want to divide.

My only real expertise is on how things sound, and how to cut out noise. That's most of what composition is to me.

I think a type 1 civilization is there's institutions for the arts, and 10% of the population or less are considered artists.

A type 2 civilization is when all humans view each other as artists, and historically rich mediums such as instrument, painting, writing, and building are all as commonplace as following sports, celebrities, and politics in 2k19.

I hear music all the time around me. There needs to be a less of an emphasis on money.

I don't think we should be working for money, we should be working for each other and our own self interests.
I think more slaves exist today than at any other point in human history, they don't know it.
All my songs are free, all my art is free. I think we should all be working towards that type 2 civilization when it comes to the arts. Painting, poetry, writing, should be as commonplace as Starbucks in the modern world.
Art is itself the pursuit of truth, and truths.

I'll help anyone in anyway I can I think being wealthy is why we have the poor. Those are a handful of my unpopular beliefs, the posts for more context. I live to make are because that's what pursuit of truth. I live in the states, and most look like fake derivatives of others. I think the internet is becoming homogenized, and I'm real against that. I'm of the school of thought of competence.

## big pic <a name="bigPic"></a>

I see race foremost as an attribute of being human, and you can find interesting statistics on good or bad. I think language today has been stripped down by those who have the unlimited coke plane rides and slaves and it's still not enough.

I have dedicated my entire life to reducing suffering in the fastest way possible, and although my actions may not look it, that's the primary focus of my life.

I think of time on a 500 year scale for the 'human' race. I remember ever since before the start of the industrial age, there has been an economy based off the end of our species. I think most will not notice if and when AI takes over.

I record every day, just the candid of real life most of the time. When there's a camera in my hands, I love directing without directing, and instead focus on the candid and real.

> ask yourself, how do you approach music, what's your approach to life?

### The POLIW.AT umbrella <a name="poliwatUmbrella"></a>

POLIW.AT is a few things:  

1. artist name

2. brain dump

3. my last safe space (my own social media)

4. open source projects for others to join

5. a more rigorous way to pursue truth(s) outside of multidisciplinary arts

6. a metaphysical operating system with a focus on
    - training on the boundaries and journeys from point A to B outside of our perception,
        in a way that provides more insight, meaning, connectedness, context with the base reality you're born with

7. a methodology humans that are being told they're crazy  

8. an exercise in free thought

^^ all this long form lyrics, in base reality I'm a poor and passionate lyricist and composer at 27, looking for a space to flourish. Dad's dying of cancer and mom's real poor and I can't send money because of the above unpopular beliefs. If you'd like a house show, an artist in residence, a camp counselor, programmer,

Most of my work lately is inspired from mysteries of the feminine. I am highly social but live in isolated situations usually off women I love.

### Anti-folk <a name="Anti-folk"></a>
Anti folk started in the 90s (though kinda has been around since the lute)
and is a more self aware, sarcastic version of traditional folk.

## Schizop <a name="Schizop"></a>
Schizop as a sub-genre of experimental hiphop, where the vocalist is speaking from multiple perspectives, usually contradictive, and sourced in surreal/abstract places.

<b>(i.e.)</b>
Like multiple people in one but with a driven narrative, where you show both sides of the opinion from the same person then drive the new point home, over and over again.

## POLIW.AT LOVES YOU [PLU]<a name="poliwat-loves-you"></a>

##### 1. PLU the song structure

Think of the format of a song:

> -intro -verse1 -chorus -bridge -verse2 -chorus -bridge -outro

Imagine if each of our scene format like a song, was:

  > Hop Skip Jump Drop L Cooz Friend

If each of the following was a section of the piece as a whole, such as a verse chorus verse, each section containing a single piece of music and video that stands on itself, the sections would be the same.

##### 2. PLU the multiverse

###### 1 Hop: Digital space

Anonymous computer user. How users uses their computers, recorded from the screen.

Hop - Each QT log has info/creds/context right up front about the piece

AUDIO: REAL SAMPLED MATERIAL && VIDEO: QT LOG SCREENTIME

Where: Digital Reality Universe. Digital spaces on computer, as QT logs (-qt) in the Vault 36 media library.

Who: humanity as a whole

2. Skip

7. Friend


##### 3. PLU the philosophy

## POLIW.AT Music Videos

Music is not a purely auditory experience, it is also a visual medium. When we hear audio, our brains want to fill in the visual gaps. My poliw.at music videos are a pursuit of reflecting this exchange where I use visual instruments and a suite of video tools to create the videos in real time.

## Federal Beat Reserve
The name plays upon the idea that the US government might officially support the creative cataloging of music for the people, through the action of encapsulating everything semantic into a discrete duration of instrumental music. This project is inspired by open source philosophy in software development, where all the work and its underlying components, are exposed to be remixed, reused, edited, and developed on in an open and transparent way.
You can listen to the Instrumentals across the web available here. Open source and always free.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1032909743/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://poliwat.bandcamp.com/album/federal-beat-reserve-antidepressants">Federal Beat Reserve: Antidepressants by POLIW.AT</a></iframe>

#### Pale Blue Dawt Podcast ++ Radio Show

Pale Blue Dawt, aired on 91.1fm at KZSU Stanford. A hybrid between a podcast and a music show, PBD is an hour long weekly radio show journeying through my sound library where my music augments field recordings and interviews. My particuar focus is on recording things that would otherwise not be recorded. This includes but is not limited to; intimate gatherings, DIY and original music, classes, ceremonies, funerals, reunions, and people talking candidly about the things that matter to them most. Sounds kind of like life, the musical.

## Pilot's Logs (composers diaries)

What does a safe space look like to you? For me it is a place where I can openly communicate - something that is often impossible without negatively affecting others. My composers are a series of online av diaries in pursuit in a form of open communication. An action of attempting to open source my brain that serves as a tool for song writing, and navigating the world around me.

Across these links you can find over 700 private tracks of personal audio projects, drafts, rants, savage edits, therapy sessions, noise, parties, ceremonies, secrets, anything........

## Freestyler's Anonymous

Hello my name is poliw.at and I'm a freestylAholic(rapAholic)

I have a disease and it's freestyling. Based off the 12 step program, the first step is admitting I am powerless over the pursuit of stopping freestyling.

The second step is acknowledge the fact that the only way to get clean off freestyling is to continue to freestyle, until the moment you don't need to anymore.

Meetings are everyday, TBA online and wherever I am. Audio from freestyle sessions are found
