#### lyrics:

```
independent platform
||capitalizing on the longform
||technological transformation
possibility of dialogue||

End of capital the verb

lack of interference
unmediated media
you can’t misrepresent
people anymore

its okay miles
you’re parents have agreed
to become zombies

so that you
can think indecently

the weight of nothing()
and everything lies
on your shoulders

people hear what the see
so don't talk
about what you can show

and you’ll feel
so much better
when you have money

thats what they all say
but will I
still think clearly?

no answer(null)
```
