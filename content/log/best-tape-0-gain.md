**Saturday 936 AM**

So last night my cousin R called me. He's a military guy on the east coast. We had the most HILARIOUS and loving short talk, best tape of my life. I was recording but had the gain on the mic at 0, so I got none of it.

These are are the moments you become used to when chasing tape. Cause tape can't be chased. You can only set the parameters of the situation, that's when the best tape occurs. But the best things in life cannot be recorded. At least with the parties knowledge. Last night JL and I had too much fun rapping bob dylan lyrics into a trap type song. I'm very stoked about my radio show! I'm going all out on this one.

Also called DD yesterday and got an add code for his electronic ensemble. I'll add the class then I have an excuse to come to SC once a week :)
