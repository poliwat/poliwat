4. Always say less than necessary

5. So Much depends on Reputation

        👩🏽‍🌾 Guard it with your life

        👩🏽‍🌾 Erwin Rommel, the soldier everyone was afraid to face.

6. Court Attention at all costs

        👩🏽‍🌾 Pablo would rather paint something disgusting
        than something ignored.

7. Get others to do the work for you

        👩🏽‍🌾 Edison wasn't great with electronics but
        was instead a businessman. He shafted Tesla
        and sucks a massive chode.

8. Make other people come to you. Use bait if necessary.

9. Win through your actions, not through your argument

        👩🏽🌾 Mucianus and the engineer

        👩🏽🌾 Mucianus wanted to conquer worlds with
        the best ship, and one of the engineers of
        the ship told him this wasn't the best ship,
        so he had him killed.

13. Asking for help appeals to people's self-interest

14. Pose as a friend, work as a spy

        👩🏽🌾 Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord
        and Napoleon Bonaparte

15. Crush your enemy totally

16. Use absence to increase respect and honor

    👩🏽🌾 _Why do I not see you more often?_

    👮🏽‍♀️ _Because the words "why have you not been to see me" are sweeter to my ear than the words "Why have you come again?"_

    👮🏽‍♀️ _- Mulla Jami, quoted in Idries Sha's Caravan of Dreams, 1968_

17. Cultivate an air of unpredictability

        👩🏽‍🌾 Pablo Picasso and Paul Rossenberg
            When Pablo got successful he would
            randomly say he wasn't going to work
            with patrons, and they would freak
            out and increase the price.

18. Isolation is Dangerous

19. Do no offend the wrong person

        👩🏽‍🌾 Inalchik and Ghengis Khan

23. Concentrate your forces

24. Play the perfect Courtier

        👩🏽 ‍🌾 Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord,
          the man who brought down Napoleon.

        👩🏽‍🌾 The perfect courtier obeys his masters,
        👩🏽‍🌾 but shines in his own light. He is not powerless,

        👩🏽‍🌾 doesn't trust, but appears trustful, doesn't talk
        👩🏽‍🌾 much, but finds the right words and the right

        👩🏽‍🌾 timing when he does. Everyone likes him.
        👩🏽‍🌾 He is charming,
        👩🏽‍🌾 witty, and helpful. He appears to be neutral,

        👩🏽‍🌾 a paragon of honesty and fairness.
        👩🏽‍🌾 He always has a genuine smile
        👩🏽‍🌾 on his face and we don't doubt his

        👩🏽‍🌾 intentions for one second.
        👩🏽‍🌾 Although he is a great talent,
        👩🏽‍🌾 we are not threatened by him.
        👩🏽‍🌾 We seek him as an ally.

    ```

    - _Friedrich Nietzsche_

    we tend to search for meaning in a world full of chaos

            this is how elections and anything important decisions are made.

32. Play to people's fantasies

    - if it sounds too good to be true

33. Discover each human's thumbscrew

    it pays not to accept 'free gifts'

41. Avoid stepping in a great man's shoes

42. Strike the Shepherd and the sheep will scatter

43. Work on the heart and mind of others

    - Loiux XV

    "
    wherever Alcibiades went, whoever he had to deal with, he would leave behind his own values and appear to share the values of his victims.

    no one could resist a man who not only concurred with them, but also admired their ways of living, seeming to be one of their own.

    "

*159 PM*

I can't help myself. I want to draw. I want to be able to draw humans well, and quickly.

I have this book on anatomy drawing and I'm going to bend the rules - this is helpful in drafting shots for poliwat I believe. But really I should specialize and focus only on the sound aspects, because that is already difficult enough. 20 minutes on drawing, I can't help myself.


*228 PM*

Alright it looks like either my teensy 3.6 board is defective, or I burned it out on accident by running 4.5 volts into it's 3.3v power supply pin.

I have $183 to my name, and there's no choice but to purchase this.




*619 pm*  


People think of sound progressing two dimensionally, like
notes on stalves, every representation of music is 2D. (how else could you do it?)
Well that influences how we write our music. Because our ears inclination in music moving forward is how we define music. Music can go any direction in a 3D grid thought. The orientation of a song, scale, or key to revolve around 16 as much as it revolves around 12. The music is happening 3 dimensionally, and the movement of the listener is not just forward like in more tradditional ideas of music (chord progressions) or backward, but also up or down. Moving throughout a sort of grid.
