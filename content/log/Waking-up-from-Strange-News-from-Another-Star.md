**1015AM**

finally a timestamp

\\

that was a month where dtme

didnt exits

````

death was life and life was death
and they were locked together in an eternal mad lmove battle
and this was the final word
and the meaning of the world
and thence came a radiance that could glorify all misery
and thence came a shadow that trumpeted all joy and beauty
but from out of this darkness joy burned more intimately
and more beautifully and love had a deeper glow
within this night

-from flute dreams by herman hesse (Strange news from a another star)

<!-- **1304 (before)**

literally moms telling me to leave cause I said calm down once

dad is asking me to stay here and hang out with him but it's impossible

she's too stressed telling me I'm not helping  

please help please help

me and helen already cried  

please please please just bring everyone over again I can't do it myself


**1304 (now)**

jumped on trampoline 200 bounces just finished helping dad poop in the komodo that arrived 4 days late or something. || helen's a goddess and todays the day her dad died about 8 years ago today. I'm trying to be healthy and nonargumentative she whispered the new lines in the screenplay
