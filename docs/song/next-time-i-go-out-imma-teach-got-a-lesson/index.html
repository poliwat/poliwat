next time I go out Ima teach God a lesson
next time I go out Ima teach God a lesson
next time I go out Ima teach God a lesson
next time I go out Ima teach God a lesson
[verse 1]
gotta lesson from the drunk shaman
maybe they woke hobo
as of late they my therapy today
I need I breath it a clean slate
off pero slate lake
stop crying over lost tape
a la carte trip
suddenly I a monk
handsome youth having fun
he chose the pen
I chose the sword and his temple
well tortured to death
there's snow on his sleeve
and better yet I make a plan
to fuck for a living
believe wouldnt you
these discoveries
my discoveries
gotta nother lesson from the broke bishop
pro bono bonobo in peripheral
next time I go out Imma leave a note
(saying)
next time I go out Imma teach god a lesson
next time I go out Imma teach god a lesson
next time I go out Imma teach god a lesson
next time I go out Imma teach god a lesson
[verse 2]
gotta lesson from the pea pod
he showed up to my lab God
to fancy a man it's absurd
as God smiles at my work
wip out my pea pod
on the dance floor God
your studies made you great
gave you great
graitification
won't be long
when world sees my works work
hypothesis of his hips
reminds me of my pea pod God
Deoxyribonucleic acid
fact checks my pea pod dog

a complicated remark
celibate life's hard
gotta lesson from the pea pod God
then he showed up to my lab dog
when he showed up to my lab ha
when he showed up to my lab HAHA

gotta lesson from a pea pod dog
last words needs work
look at me now God
look at me now dog
when I go out it's after confession(saying)

<p>old notes:</p>

<h3 id="newsong">#newsong</h3>

<p>concept:</p>

<p>gregor mendel was celebit his whole life - but the whole reason he loved breeding plants was because he was a homosexual.
You couldn&rsquo;t be gay back then so he redirected his homo desires into plants.</p>

<p>But it took one special night to start doing this.</p>

<p>And he was a conflicted priest for a few years, and then one summer night snuck out and hit the city for the weekend.</p>

<p>Then he found a dude and had gay sex, and that was his only seuxual encounter his whole life. When he did that night, he came up with the idea to study pea pods. So he lived the rest of his life redirecting his homosuality into something for the entire society.</p>

for the two of us
backed by lucy


offer some food for thought to an old growth

cassy never hit me back
judge I need advice on that
it ain't got no clip
cassy damper take a sip
from justice
A huge Winecup overflowing with love
Fireflies work their asses in heaven above
too
boo
red light district of bug
I bugged out then bug you
till you shout
you too cute
n cuddly and worth it
make fun of your superstition
intuition
mantra of a thousand
thousand thoughts
thousand heads
thousand other on earth
trying to do what you do you fed
i ate i ate I fed
I fed up with federal beat reserve
my marriage

!###{READ UP FROM HERE}##$!

Loved by a Man in a Box
sweat by noon bleed by nine
no girl could keep up with me
testosterone all i need
till I dead
A huge Winecup overflowing with love
A secret visit leading to the wrong bed
An unknown robe to remember him by

mantra of a thousand
a thousand bots

I use em to my advantage
and channel your what nots


being my ownly company

Loved by a Man in a Box
sweat by noon bleed by nine
no girl could keep up with me
testosterone all i need
till I dead
A huge Winecup overflowing with love
A secret visit leading to the wrong bed
An unknown robe to remember him by

Who Wears the Incense Graph Dyed in Her Heart?

Siamese Roosters and the Reluctant Farewell

A Verse Sung by a Goblin with a Beautiful Voice


imagine a goblin with a beaitful voice
that's what i see in that fat boy
we don't talk about her choice
pro choice I old school new rules
voodoo youtube
don't comment unless it lit
share it don't like it
millenials afraid to commit
flaky flaky flaky flaky flaky
flaky flaky flaky
I spank thee as tibult getting sloppy seconds from romeo   

that buzzfeed simple speak propaganda
media out for cigs
daddy never came
I cum I ate
I should've worked out today

I woulda coulda fuck you future

I don't want my name on a basketball
