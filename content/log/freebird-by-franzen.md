*Sunday 832 AM*

Woke up early so I could get some work done. Katie's coming by with a thermos full of coffee at 10. We will checkout the local graveyard I assume, but it's up in the air.

Tripping out to Slyvia's voice currently. It's amazing. One of the last tracks on our first album as Jimmothy Leary. There's about 10 tracks in my iTunes. James and I spent a lot of time yesterday bouncing tracks and figuring out the order of the album. It's going well, there's enough material for an album for sure. We just have to figure it out.

I thought I lost the Franzen book when I got drunk on Friday night. But it was just found all sandy in the bottom of my backpack. We hid the backpack under the stage where smash mouth was playing and jumped in the ocean. That book has mine and jack's tickets so I was worried. It's a benefit for *Planned Parenthood*. Franzen will be among 4 authors, I don't even know the names of the others. I need to get us as far as I can on Jimmothy Leary work because next month is all about finishing POLIWAT. I'll take some time to fill in the poliwat master doc on here, there are old logs on my lappy I can find when I described the composition suit in full. September 28th is the magic date. And the reason I'm making POLIWAT, David Dunn will be 'teaching' at UCSC around the 24th. Can't wait to show him.

What's a worse feeling than when the internet doesn't work?

Why is my work so heavily reliant on the web?
