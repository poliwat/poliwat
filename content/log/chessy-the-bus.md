How many times have you texted someone I love you in a grocery line
how many times will I drink a sip too many and
say something just outside of bounds
but there is no longer a ref to call it
how many fouls can you get away with in life, and how?
thatâ€™s a quora question.

how many times will I fall in love?
how many times will I fail before I succeed

how many times will I do a load of laundry and I find your cute undies all wrinkled up enveloped by my john thompson rags.

1 time
this time is different
