Visiting Helen's Aunt and family in LA until Saturday. Got a ride with two of their old time best friends Robbie and Debbie who came from Los Osos. Everyone is so kind smart and funny and I love the company. Robbie's an artist and us three had great talks on the way down.

The grief of my dad's passing is catching up to me, now that I left Nipomo, cause there wasn't much room to grieve there

sad angry

This guest house we're staying in is so beautiful, the house is a perfect balance between relaxed and clean and warm and classy in a not soulless way. The guest house is so cute, full rhodes piano from (1969), drumset, bass and amp, everything's already micced and running into a scarlett interface, but the usb port is broken on it, it's missing a piece of plastic. I really really really wish I brought mine. Never again am I traveling without it. Cause I have so many ugly emotions of sadness anger grief and I just want to encapsulate that energy into tracks, but we gotta waoit to hit up ben and hue to help me out. helens making breakfast. I can at least plan out each track or pre production work in the meantime. I can't do the right thing right now my emotions are in the way like a brick wall. But I smoked a stoge and I'm sitting outside with italian press coffee, (it was just camping coffee I used to have but never knew it was italian press, it was just what I used when I went camping).

So anyways who knows who cares what I think right now I just need to get out of here (mentally) and into the next next, which will be a laptop day of pre prod work instead of blah blah

oh and the adult swim contest thing is tonight so I wanna submit my throwaway polecat idea. It started as a throwaway idea but has gotten great responses so IDK about signing it all away to adult swim just to pitch it, but I've got nothing else going down income wise so could really use the prize money. And Ben is playing 7:30 - 8 so the thing is 8 - 9 so I gotta go do it at a coffee shop near the venue, it's some corona sponsored event. But it'll be cool.
