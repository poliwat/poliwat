this isnt me
im sorry forgot
that they were planted
that liquid I drank
that it was all that stuff
about how to live my life
you almost got me
I just wanted
it more than anything in full force

they fucking got me
these aren't my thoughts
these aren't my thoughts
these aren't my thoughts

I'm here
I use my music to find me
I trust my music not me
sometimes think sometimes
we need more in the streets sometimes
but its a wonder we make peace sometimes
holy teets what is real and
what is fake sometimes
that's what 6
