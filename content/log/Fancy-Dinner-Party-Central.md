Sunday. We're still waking up, the bed is in a new position! Last night was kind of life changing, at least it made me focused. I want to be able to live in a place like that, with a charcoaled out tree trunk and statues and huge books in my living room.

I'm real focused on taking my work to the next level.

It's a lie I'm not focused at all but am driven to be.

There's so much I want to do today I feel the pressure of it all and want to start, but also it's Sunday and Sundays are reserved strictly for R and R, which usually means playing house with H and hanging. Andres came back with us last night and we just all had a nice bagel session at the table.

I keep thinking about the tree in his parent's fancy apartment, and the statues.
I placed my hand on the trunk, it was painted black, and I felt this warm sensation coarsing from my heart to the tree, and back. It felt like electricity, but more warm and less sparky. It was an amazing sensation - and I thought I want this. If I fill my place with objects, tactile friendly objects, I won't need any drugs. And that's the secret. I tried to get addicted to the idea, and started recording the night, just because I want to memorize and reinforce that mindset revelation the apartment gave me. Popping it in Ableton now.
