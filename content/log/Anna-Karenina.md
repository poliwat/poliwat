@Lulu's in downtown SC. Listening to the women's march dance tune AHA! I love it.

Anna is sitting next to me, my TA for a marixsm class a couple years ago.

I didn't say hi but did say 'god bless you'. She's grading papers from section, just like when I was in the course. She got more stylin for sure. Not that she ever wasn't.



SBGC still gives me goosebumps so fucking cool.

First Friday was SO FUN LAST NIGHT!!! I went all out, met cool people, and am inspired to work hard. I definitely got my fix aha.

So I'm selling this car on Thursday, and going all out on selling lasercut stuff.

All I need to do is start writing the recipes. I can publish them privately on the pbd site.
