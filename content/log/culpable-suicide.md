**Tuesday 944 AM**

Made it back home to parent's before 2AM last night. Gave no warning as my phone wouldn't take a charge - it was sandy from the beach.

Managing my stress levels today is the name of the game, while working on the more fun sides of poliw.at.

I want to get a map working by the time I have to leave.

I addition I just want to make my own font out here lol, and import that into poliw.at. That's just too cool.
