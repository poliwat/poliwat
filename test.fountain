.INTHEBEGINNING - OVERTURE #69

POLECAT
hi I'm Polecat, my mom named me. In greek it means miracle, and the only miracle in my life is that I'm still here. Cause the doctors can't find whats wrong with me. My family practioner dr. martini has been my vet since the Betts family adopted me.
so far I have a rare combinational form of narcolepsy, recurring dreams, recurring nightmares. My mom said I was hypochondriac.

DR. MARTINI
Welcome in polecat

see when it looks in the mirror

and each episode is a hopeless journey through a bottomless pit, using music as a guide

the first one is paranoia

the second one is schizophrenia

polecat goes to the therapist

polecat goes to the doctor, doctor’s can’t see the pole
