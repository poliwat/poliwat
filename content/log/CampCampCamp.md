**Friday 234 PM**

Way too excited right now to be productive. I'm terrified to look at my bank account. But I did just get paid.

### CAMP WAS SO FUN

There's so many cool people here, it's unreal. About to get a ride from Kiev to San Fran, where I'll probably jump on Caltrain (or hang with gusTedCam for a few hours), where I'll deep clean.

Now it's all about, clean moving and applying for 3 places:

I'll find out soon about the grant funding for the webmaster stuff with Tom, but I'm not banking on it (well I shouldn't be banking on it)

So this week is all about moving, and making a video resume for onewheel, inboard, and also that Steve guy.

I also gotta apply for camp.
