> Songs from the the beginning of when I started writing songs, in the closest possible order I can remember, with links to them. Chords, sheet music, charts, and reference audio or video is updated often. The following are just the list of songs, just go to https://poliw.at/tags/song and then use command or control F to find the song from this list.
