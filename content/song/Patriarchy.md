#### Lyrics

```
father is a doctor who likes his toys
plays with a rubber ducky in the jacuzzi like a boy

mother is a mother who hates few things
except for when I leave when I leave dirty dishes in the sink

sister’s got it going with her boyfriend
sister’s got it going with her religion
till they break up pick up the pieces
pick up all the itty bitty sisters pieces
x2

I don’t know what to think about that
I don't what to think think about that
I don't know what to think think about that
patriarchy oh no oh yeah
```
