**thursday 519 PM**

Spent the day on the laser cutter, and catching up with housemates.

downloading windows 7 because that's what the laser cutter needs, nick's old windows 10 laptop is too new ahahaha.

currently taking a shit.

Woke up to a quarter cig and redbull. Then max smoked me out and we worked on sampling a lofi beat together.

I want to make better music. I am just so busy with everything, and I'm so so very stressed about money.

These next 30 days are crucial to getting PBD to pay my rent. Plus I got some podcast editing so I'm stoked on that. Next week a producer from Snap is going to give a presentation in Oakland on starytelling, so I'll go to that fully stocked with laser cut PBD tree planks. That's a deadline. And I'll be fishing for donations.

Pale Blue About Master Document

Hello! I'm Michael Betts.

3 ways to describe pbd

As a producer, it's sort of where I'm at in life. Acoustically

First of all, PALE BLUE DAWT is the FCC version for KZSU in Palo Alto, California.
paleblue.fm

In the episodes on paleblue.fm, you'll hear real life stuff. That includes all the sailor's mouths and less pretty sides of humanity. You will also hear candid conversations on virtually any topic. I love finding passionate people that have such an intimate connection to their interests. That's some of my favorite tape.  


Pale Blue . is a relaxing blend of music, humans talking, poetry, nature sounds, and all good things sonic. It's called Pale Blue Dot because it sounds like Life, the musical.



While doing pale blue dot - I am making these assumptions:

(1) the listener is smart, and doesn't need to be told what they are hearing
(2) NO PREACHING
(3) NO Drug use { sometimes it slips in }


You cannot have a rule without an exception
I'm a walking on at that



What you're hearing
