  <p><p>It&rsquo;s funny what you can spew without knowing it as spew.</p>

<p>All work has stopped as soon as the Meisner first DVD started last night while Helen was working. Becca won this two disc 9 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour acting course where Sandy Meisner has some hole in his throat so he can talk because he was a chimney smoker and you can learn acting from him sounding like Darth Vader and still smoking in the class.</p>

<p>I know I haven&rsquo;t been smoking, but Becca gave me a pack of smokes on my birthday and yesterday I finished the last one&hellip;. then dipped into her pack for a night cap. So I quit. I won&rsquo;t buy them, I won&rsquo;t bum them. But if they are given to me, it looks like I wasn&rsquo;t able to ration them at all but aspire to do so one day. I fucked up my face anyways, it looks way more fucked up in the mirror now.</p>

<p>The day I made a dailies list, I really took them seriously. But it&rsquo;s been two days and I&rsquo;ve never been more lethargic in my life. That&rsquo;s an over exaggeration.</p>

<p>Becca&rsquo;s dad sent her pizza and beer money and I bought the beer a few days ago at Walgreens where they were only letting 10 people in the store at a time, and there was a line out the door. So when I got in I went all out a bit. 4 bags of chips and 24 miller high life, and 1 6 pack of Lagunitas IPAs, beer for 4, for a month. I&rsquo;m not drinking nearly as much as I used to.</p>

<p>Talked to Jack while waiting in line. Jack probably got hired at FB so it&rsquo;s sweet he&rsquo;s moving to NY again.</p>
