About to go help Niko build the foundation for a workshop he's doing on building adobe homes.

I'm always behind schedule but this day is lining up great. After adobe life I'll scoot down the hill and take poliw.at down to Hunter's house. There is no POLIW.AT without Hunter, and we've just talked about it so far! It'll be the first session with physically touching the vest and components, it's super fun. It goes family, friends, POLIW.AT as far as reasons not to kill myself. I constantly zone out and imagine what I'll be able to do with POLIW.AT in these different acoustic environments.

```
worst dealer I just give it
Katieâ€™s bday I feel it
On my way with adrienne!
See you see you when
I late, always high outside
Helicon touch coming to you
That the looper magic
Those that master the loop
The game

(Chorus)
I got my vocalist looper
For dem bday Shubat loops!

Next time I go out
Ima teach god a lesson

Got a lesson from the drunk shaman
