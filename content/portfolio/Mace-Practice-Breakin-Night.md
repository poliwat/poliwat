**1026**


forgot all the good good lyrics of yesterday and maybe cause they weren't

Someone threw a rock into the studio window last night at (eagle)aka hb but we weren't there. We were sleeping in the haunted room max sees ghosts. We only heard some weird noises and then someone whispered to just me but Helen didn't  hear it. Slept like a rock despite all this and we slept in till 10, have another long day working, I'll be painting in an hour or 2 and papa is making us eggs right now. Chris is going to send some mullah to get this laptop fixed so I'm really saved <3
