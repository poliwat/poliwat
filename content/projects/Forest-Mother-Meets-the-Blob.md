<p>FMMTB explores how ritualistic aspects of womanhood shape - and are shaped by - the modern world. Basic computer vision is applied to detect the continuous forms - &lsquo;blobs&rsquo; - of the dancers. The computer loosely follows them throughout their ritual - they are a discrete system of order amongst noise.</p>

<p>This piece was performed at the Stanford GRID - a 30&rsquo; x 30&rsquo; laser grid with a waterfall for video projection. The project was set up in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley&rsquo;s Frankenstein.</p>
