Okay time to start I've been in the studio for a while now with criminally low blood sugar, bought a peanut seasme salad and croisant, and Avery and I are going to do GRID together tomorrow night so I think I'll stick around town for it. Getting food will be a challenge though :)

**Monday 232 PM**

when it comes to love

I might save a soul, saving mine along the way.

how many times can I write

Love, Michael Betts

before I feel it change into something beyond me

1000 times?

1000 is a metaphor number

the actual number is chosen at the time you've chosen.

when you go from vantage point to sewage is when you go from deciding the action to performing it.


**Monday 845 PM**


what are the right questions?

What questions should I ask when

its the first of the month,

pull up siri, alexa or whatever

set a reminder for the 1st of each month...

ask yourself,

what holidays are happening this month?

whose birthdays are happening?


A lesson from the lawyer,
if you want to make a point you're going to need a case.

and I want to make a point of living a good long life,
without regrets and blah blah blah don't kill myself yet
please atleast until my family's dead.    

build up a case

evidence that you didn't exist

but evidence that you tried

that you tried to make the world a better place

the most effective and honest way you could think of

with the love and support from the quality relationships

that you love to explore, cherish, and cultivate.

if it's the 1st of the month and depression

hasn't taken my involuntary soul   

then for the record, these are the questions I pledge to ask

on the 1st of every month.

**Monday 8848 PM**

for the record I'm just as productive while sober than while high (depending on the task)

but it's been a real productive day.

I am so fucking fast when there's a solid internet connection. The only hangup today is that I can't FTP aka can't access the classic functions.php file for the pale blue fm site.

Avery is coming to the station right meow and we are goint to watch the mini grid performances then perform tomorrow night together.

most people actually want equality
```
i noticed people usually
if you treat them like an equal
instead of a superior

they not only like it

they treat you like an equal back

and you both sort of engage in this

relationship where the younger person can show the newer tech

to the older one and the older one can lay down what has worked

and not worked in the field for years outside of the youngster's

scope
```

The guy at GRID told me I could play the lasers tomorrow night if I learn how to do it and he had my pull up a youtube link. Avery and I will figure it out ahahaha it'll be so fun. I'm locked out of the station still but he is about to get here and I need to fucking lay down some audio.
