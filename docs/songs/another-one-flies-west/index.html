  <p><p>Chicken Brain after pop eyes.</p>

<p><strong>2132</strong>
||
Been offline never got to get this screen fixed but setup with ted&rsquo;s monitor in the room . been sleeping next to dad since flying back, maybe it&rsquo;s been seven days now. yeah about that really. this is the hardest period of my life. || dads in the hospice bed and I&rsquo;ve been recording every day; people visiting, mom and I taking care of him, music, the nurses, bonnie and her two daughters, phone calls, voicemails, etc. Today was the first day I was really paralyzed with grief and was mostly planted next to my dad wherever he wanted to post up - I played his tele with a battery amp lying back on the couch, the hammock, the piano bench, the stool. I asjdadfljasdf can&rsquo;t think straight and neither can my mom, and my dad&rsquo;s taking morphene every day since before I got back so he&rsquo;s a little loopy so Helen is going to be like gandalf the white when she arrives about wednesday night. I&rsquo;ll pick her up in slo.</p>

<p>I want to write about all that&rsquo;s been happening and it&rsquo;s mostly been chicken scribbles of events without thought. I&rsquo;m aimless except for this setlist of some of my best songs I want to do with jordan and his brother daniel as a way of therapy. it&rsquo;ll sound like smooth rnb hip hop with a touch of mac miller vibes. 2 guitars with octave pedals and a cahone to start then jordan&rsquo;s bare minimum drum kit with soft sticks / brushes. just light and smooth baby. that&rsquo;s all I want to play lately it&rsquo;s just good mediciene. haven&rsquo;t been drowning myself in substances either, been totally clean all week aside from the hilarious situation of my dad asking his buddy dennis to bring a bottle of tequila over, and him and my mom are both alcoholics so it was just tooo funny getting us four to cheers to the &lsquo;time we have left&rsquo; with my dad in the hospice bed and we each had about half a shot. It tasted way to smooth for all of us,  and it was abrasive and awkward but we managed to put the bottle away, and it&rsquo;s been sittiing in the dish washer since then, cause that&rsquo;s where my dad said to put it. I was real surprised she put it there, knowing I know where it is. Dad has called me the beer locust here, I&rsquo;ve been known to drink all their alcohol and they don&rsquo;t notice till those critical times they really want a drink. || gonna audio edit allllllll this stuff</p>
