#### Lyrics

```
# Lryics
```
I am lost but I have found
but it's not what I lost

and every grump has been a child
every drunk has been a child
every girl has been a child
I know I've been one hun hunnnn

and every lesson learned soon to be forgotten

I say there's hope
in the way
she looks she looks at his face
there is hope there is hope there is hope

and every moment

```

```
