In many ways I'm at a loss for words.

Why am I here?

How do I get healthy?

I need to finish the book for after rehab. I think Imma work on that.

Also gotta do this and that, it doesn't really matter. I don't care anymore in a few ways.

    ### On the scene with Darlene


    Hey darlene!

    I just wanted to take a second and write you a personal message

    you left yourself logged on the computer in studio C so I wrote an email and sent it to yourself.

    going to bukowski this

    but bottom line

    {phone call with darlene her talking about getting an email from herself and thinking she wrote the letter}


    when in reality I wrote the letter. well not really, I only had about 5 minutes and meesh was in a rush so I copy pasted some other letter and modified it so it applied to yourself.

    Darlene


    perfectionism and failure therapy

    I sold my bus

    and moved into this house

    and what I got was

    really great relationships

    with people I really trust and love

    Train my mind

    My mind is already well trained
    I won't say more

    But the next thing to work on is this invasive thought that prevents me from action, or deludes me into actions revolving self mutilation

    what is self mutilation and why?

    why would I want to kill myself?

    Because what's one of the major goals in life?
          it's go transcend yuor reality. to go through the looking glass.
