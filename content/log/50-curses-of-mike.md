**Tuesday 1139 AM**

barely made it on the amtrack train! well not really had like 15 minutes to spare, but it was real stressful getting here. My phone kept glitching out while I was stuck in traffic on the 17, banking the train being later than myself. Now the phone won't boot, so I get to enjoy the next 5 hours completely by myself. I didn't set up for getting picked up yet, so I'll either find a friendly passenger or hit a coffee shop in SLO and reach out to them over wifi.

Today is September 4th. I originally intended on hitting my parent's house by the 1st, but like the lady on the train said when I spilled some Dr. Pepper, life happens. I hate myself that's why I'm drinking soda right now. Also eating subway, just like the olden days.

I'm just tired of hating myself, or loathing myself. I felt a strong urge to leave my house in Santa Cruz, it's just simply not a productive workspace. Yesterday I had about an hour and half of hangups on account of the internet, which was honestly workable and alright. I made a full track, instrumental, vocal, then video. I'm going to make 50 of these in this workflow. I think that's the best way to tackle asking from money on patreon, just make videos every day and people can drop me some monthly money for uploads or something.

brb getting a coffee.

My anxiety levels have been through the roof. Few notice because I'm a learned man at this point and can usually feign how I feel for the sake of others.

also I had some hilarious thoughts on vibe while driving the 17 but can't freaking remember!      

50 shades of mike

im talking

and shut the front door
sweep yo ma's sides porch

I am religious
I wrote my own religion

everything is leverage
make fun of your superstitions
so so so
sweep yo mammas' porch
and shut the front door
sweep yo ma's sides porch
shut the front door

Im talking why I sad over this piano tape
why cant I stop typing to tell any mate
that I tired of living all up in a moments notice
thats why I zone out zone in so good at home so focused

so sweep yo mamms porch
shut the front door
sweep yo ma's sides porch
swoon swoop

Im talking bless up

lemon grass in the trees
lemon grass on her lips
lemon grass in my hair
lemon grass when we kiss

armpits skate sesh

neckurn from the wetsuit
rug burn from jujistu   

lemon grass
I'm talking
ass grass or cash if you ride with me
die with me please
Im lonely
Im funny Im horny Im going
places


I walk out
I'm walking  

I walk out too fast
missed it
so bottle gripped
mother alcoholic
she called me an idiot savant
in french I cannot
understand why I'm not afraid of it man

monogamy monologue michael
just gotta find the right flight tho
which one
they set it up for you
I'll set it up for two

my dreams my passion
my profession my confessions
