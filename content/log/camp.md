**Moonday 1052 AM**

@camp, day 1 - going to be here for two weeks.Avery gave me a 64 gb ipod and I'm loading it with all sorts of tunes now!!! Life has been so good, I haven't had a chance to do a decent log lately. Been getting fire audio on the regs, and have been blasting through it.




**monday 858 pm**


children's book that teaches kids about addiction.

kids are eating dinner in the dining room, talking asking where dad is.

it's implied he's upstairs about to come down (but is too hung over to)

dad's coming down

he's coming down

okay just name the setting and you're good to go

come as you are


arrive as you are
but be better than you were
just in case


A wise old drunk guy once told me "Rules are there for the guidance of the wise, and obedience of the foolish."ï»¿
