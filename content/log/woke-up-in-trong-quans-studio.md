### it's called the hot haus
spent 2 whole laptop batteries cutting eclipse audio. Stefan and Jack were generous with their computers.

the hot haus is when you freestle rap over an eccletive mix of tracks, hours long after you've rapped good lines and ran out of things to spit. Also it's gotta be hot. If you're sweating, you're in the hot house. It's in these mental spaces that you may capture diamonds through the ruff.


Tuesday 537 pm
Hour after the eclipse.
Look a what's going down.

entire improv play on the way back.
