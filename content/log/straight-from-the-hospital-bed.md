Another unfinished project, but the idea is

song involving the final stage of life, and the lryics are basically your final will and testament. I imagine myself would be angry on my deathbed, and anger is an abstraction from fear. I have too many ideas to execute in one life, and that's why I'm angry.

I'm freestyling on this version. I was actually lying down on my back, in the dark. There are hours of tape of with this track, and it will be finished before I'm finished.

####### also AHAHAHAHAHA this is my new official placeholder track art.
