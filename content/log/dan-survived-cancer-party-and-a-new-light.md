**Sundat 812 AM**

recording is the only thing I could really lie about easily.

I just got up - wanted to get up at 6:30 AM but didn't have an alarm. I'll hopefully find one in the shed tonight. I will take a sleep aide as well.


Cause what I'm doing is building the new routine. No distractions, just the bare minimum dope routine of all the stuff I love. I mean there's a trampoline here. I'm just glad I'm doing recovery here right now instead of in a mental facility. Which always seems to be in the peripheral. It's funny how people think of how functional I seem. Well become a patron for my art and I can be functional. Until then it's my parents house and music + video all day erry day.
