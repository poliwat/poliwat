shes getting on a plane
I'm making tunes in the hot car
go till my machine dies
friends down at the beach
not a dollar on me
dab and write
addy and fight
the good fight
some authors say
we've been invaded 4 generations ago
other authors write ground zero
I write as therapy
and conspiracies theories
got to the point where it's disney
fakes litter the web
web fake and gay
got my license today
officially gender nonbinary
motha fucka !!!!
so raise a glass to that
trolls dont win man
give me one moment
I living in a tent
for my dreams
though it dont seem
I work I work I work

we are jobs
what do you do
by the way
let me do mine

I song write
blind leading the blind
what you need to hear?
with climate change
nukes in range

I live in a tent
I son write
about how

we are jobs
what do you do
by the way
let me do mine

I leave conspiracy theory
disnley land
she brings me back to earth
she just finished sidartha
on my rec
I record

they live
and the beat continues.

time to


i made the streams
cause they save me
if my stream is fucked up
im fucked up
everyone should
have their
own 24 7 feed
giving a human to share
who they are in ways they cannot
with speech
because the problem identified here (1)
is empathy
and you increase empathy
by building tools for communicating
promoting multi interdisciplinary, human centric
communicating
teaching the alphas mofo !

thats how we help
representing their mind

thats what the feed is

it saves me

build the dark one
then use the dark one to get out
and build a light one

and in the mean time helen

write that fucking script !! !

N O W ! ! !

the
Things get crazier the closer you get, it seems
you and me
to be or not to be
old lines new meaning
doesn't matter what you write whne you're drunk
cause that's not the real you
closer you get to drunk
less impressive the bunk
I dunk on the daily
only way to write
only way to hide
only way to try
alchie sobers you more than mom did
every before another operation
too many fragments
where do I choose
to stop writing about a noose
on the lowkey
motif from farm honey
like without a simile
imagine language without rabies

in obscure lands of the web
they call it cancer
in my main head
I call it cancer
in my gut I feel
with wim hoff method
she reminded me
to breath
to breath in a time of need
what a lesson to preach!
but its 2k19
preaching only works on zombies
ads and derivative
fucked up versions of feeds
you think you're life should be like thee?
please
where art thou art, vocabulary
no one can freestyle even when I invite them
even when I suck
even when I freestyle
no ones invited when Im on the mic
my projectile
she told me
so now I know
wouldn't have known that
if I tapped it every day
orgasms every day
voted for that today
penniless today
free today
and eleven minutes ?
even with a full plate
I got full time spare
for you
for you myself
for you myself and irene
=-=-=-====-==-===-=--==--=-=-==--==-
I got full time to spare
too many lines
I'm outa time
to make a point
its the drunk in
me made me dumb
couldve enjoyed
this tent sober
but friends too fun
3 new tracks done
then I got dumb
freestyled bunch of new shit
1 % worth it
all worth it
more than so
cause with chris and chad
we went to the next level
chris grabbed my junk I grabbed chads
and illest village had a couple more tracks
doesn't matter what free flow is
smart pop all that matters after 2020 bitch
second shores start rising
I seent the graphs
I not pecismistic
just a preparing dad
on the vibes with the composition time
compose every day even if you don't listen to it
make it to old age so you can hear it
plead the fifth for another miscarriage
of another track unfinished
suck my dick
god don't tell anyone
cause lennon got shot for less than this
a verse about being pro abortion
if she gotta
her body her choice
you gotta
pencil dick if you don't agree
said my finnish dick said 23 and me
still messaging my cousins
no one replies
they more paranoid than me
the more you know
more the reason to be paranoid baby
