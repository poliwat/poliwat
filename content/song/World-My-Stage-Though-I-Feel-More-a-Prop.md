#### Lyrics

```
2. World my stage

(Chorus)
Bmin7        Gmaj7           Em           Emin7  - Em
world my stage though I feel more a prop
Bmin7        Gmaj7           Em           Emin7  - Em
The clues I’ve learned from view in rearview mob
Bmin7        Gmaj7           Em           Emin7  - Em
my tongue blunt tool tongue she likes on pop
Bmin7        Gmaj7           Em           Emin7  - Em
world my stage though I feel more a prop

Verse 1
I think of life like a book
that my hook
I writing it I main character I act it
ceasar said world your stage up to you what role you play
highlights high life my life is romantic god bless it
razor sharp focus every rose I notice
my religion more women in power
I think mamma love a super power
I’m a sucka though I’m a sucka for
hyrule-herb quick-jab bad-meme cute-cat
girl that make art with her hands yeah
like ma ma ma who write
20 post it notes a day
alcoholic I saw the pattern then I trained
my mental screaming I’d walk the plank
walk the plank
for my dreams
type fuck
barefeet on the coffee table
high life no coasters for dads coronas
lows worth the highs
highs come in 50 shades of mike
50 shades of pride
50 shades of couldn’t curb my taste for a glock 9
50 shades of why
(Chorus) x2
Bmin7        Gmaj7           Em           Emin7  - Em
world my stage though I feel more a prop
Bmin7        Gmaj7           Em           Emin7  - Em
The clues I’ve learned from view in rearview mob
Bmin7        Gmaj7           Em           Emin7  - Em
my tongue blunt tool tongue she likes on pop
Bmin7        Gmaj7           Em           Emin7  - Em
world my stage though I feel more a prop
