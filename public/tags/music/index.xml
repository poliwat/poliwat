      <description>The Federal Beat Reserve is the following:
 The Federal Beat Reserve is a dictionary with electronic instrumentals as the definitions. Itâ€™s name plays upon the idea that the US government might officially support the creative cataloging of music for the people. My aim is to create a non verbal sound reference for every word in language, through the action of encapsulating everything semantic into a discrete duration of instrumental music.</description>

      <description>github.center.wav by Michael Betts  Artist writeup:
The philosophy behind Github has been a big inspiration as a digital media artist
Each track is a git command line, the idea being an instrumental track you can hit play on whenever you need that command.
Tracks are all free and open source, and some of the STEMS(the ones that didn&amp;rsquo;t get lost on my broken laptop) are available here @archive</description>
