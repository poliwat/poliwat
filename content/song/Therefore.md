If the Wright brothers were left handed,
I'm left therefore I'm right and a super saiyan
The Winklevoss twins were born rich,
Therefore they are poor and I right

If knowledge is power
power is money
therefore knowledge is money honey,
and we've got plenty of that if money was love
therefore we must be happy

well
with the philosophers philosophizing
professors professing
I'm back home masterbaiting
my kids ain't listening cause
they've got better shit to do
they've got Call of Duty 2
We live in an era when you can
have your cake and eat it
have your cake and eat it
have your cake and eat it
too

bum bum
I think too much during sex,
Therefore I am too much during sex
That leads me to believe, I'm pretty bad at sex
That means I'm pretty bad at sex well

well
with the philosophers philosophizing
professors professing
I'm back home masterbaiting
my kids ain't listening cause
they've got better shit to do
they've got Call of Duty 2
We live in an era when you can
have your cake and eat it
have your cake and eat it
have your cake and eat it
too
