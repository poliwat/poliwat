Sean how do you relax?

How do I relax?


Let me put it to you straight

Everything here has been recorded since our conversation

well except for 2 things, can you guess what those are?

well for me

to relax I need to first calm my intellectual mind.

I'm sure you being so high up in academia you fall victim to this.

so let's hear something  



{
  it might not sound like Im relaxed in this tape
    but this is what I do to relax

If you can't occasionally walk into a room of cute girls and they're all tyring to get you to talk to them by acting all smiley and giggly and not want to talk to them cause you want to look at the art then you are not a man.

The human and the shooter

Know your beat. I know you're fond of walking and that you know your beat pretty well. I try to maintain a balance between dirt trails and pathed ones. The dirt trails are more fun because there's more changes in them.


This is what happens in your neighborhood.
