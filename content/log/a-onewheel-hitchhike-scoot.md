**Thursday 950 AM**

FIRE AUDIO!!!! Been getting great clips around here.

Had a nice V day in SC. Me Ian and Nick made a beat.

Last night I walked down to the stage at midnight last night. I started a little fire but put it out cause there wasn't much good firewood around.

This morning I was waiting at the bus stop but a dude came driving by in a forerunner, so I hitched a ride with him. Richard, he's my new neighbor.

De dropped me at mission, I was scooting down to the metro and I saw a woman riding a onewheel board. I asked a few questions about it, got her email, and now will apply with my video resume to be an <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/rideonewheel/a0efad98-190e-4006-b779-b00be7b25cb4">  ambassador </a>

Today I've got to mail shit!!! At all costs.

I asked about 4 girls out for V day, at least invited them to hangout. Sheila!!!!!! Has a midterm today so she couldn't hang last night but wants to next week. STOKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She's amazing.
It's a good day for a micro and then practicing TSS :D.



I've been messing with this cassette I gnabbed from my parents house during the bonzai trip. It's great,

I want to spend 7 days on domestic pscyhedlia too :D omg.

So it's all about the play and the video resume. Refer to movie for a millionaire for the resume shot list /
