**8AM**

Alone in Kyoto over breakfast making

she ties my apron

brings us back to the cherry blossom

now she going Japanese on a dick

Helen: …

OLD OLD

OLD MAN: I'm a young man with a young dick

Everyone Ya

no

I don’t wanna be like everyone

Every one with bone ear drums and rectangle thinking!
life through a box, you find their boundaries too much. Can’t talk about the real shit.

Everyones got spectacular.

A box a rectangle a smart phone.


no I prefer to know people by the meals they provide
and they don’t always know mine.
I prefer to cook all the time

I ain’t no squeaky wheel

After the first year I wanted to leave because all the squeaky wheels
were the only ones in our class getting ahead.
So I thought I’ll just be a squeaky wheel.

It’s not fair its a capitalist situation. Graduate film program

but they don’t know how rubbing aluminum in their armpits affects their cognition

but they don’t know the blue lit advertisements running marathon stretches in the living room and bedrooms affects their cognition

as is the destiny of the martry is to be sacrifice
for the 'greater good'  

the destiny of the bomb maker
