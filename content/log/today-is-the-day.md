Hey Ben,

Good Chocolate has been on my mind... a lot!

[img]

Here's a gift for your team, it's my first real engraving so it was a fun learning project.
Maybe for the Christmas season, ya'll could sell your variety pack with reusable engraved containers, it may be a hit! We could do a series of photos with the box perfectly chocolate of course, but also a sandwich / packed lunch type deal. Just like those altoids tins people buy for the container but trendier. Just a thought...

I identify well with what you said on our podcast, as well as the vision of The Good Chocolate.

I believe I could be a valuable asset to the company, and would love to discuss employment options for _anything_ you need. I have worked a wide palette of jobs, not just technical.

PS
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME MIKI MAKES HOUSE MUSIC! üî•üåç Tell him I liked the Overview Effect mix üî•üåç
