#### Kantas Pri Disciplino
(aka chants for discpline)


**June 13th 2018 on a hot summer day**

This is the first of my chant series. I've been wanting to imporve discipline, and have found great results by chanting in other ways.

So next time I'm in the field, and hit the wall but need to continue, then I can use this chant.

Each word of the chant is a human's name that showed an immense amount of perseverance and discipline in their lives.

So in this chant,
