### Lyrics  

```
life is a sacred circle
we dance to pray
we pray to heal
we heal to live
we live to dance
life is a sacred circle

```

> Originally recorded on the beaches of Lake Superior from Cathy Nelson, and she played her flute.
> This is an old prayer from the Lacota Tribe, a native people before the United States.
