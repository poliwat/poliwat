```
am I in love
or am I obsessed

im all in on her olive
shes out two hours Im obsessing

my hearts arrest
without convitction

my hearts arrest
accused and not guilty  

she leave 2 hours its rough

and when she finally walks through

I'll hate her and (sub snuff her /sub)
that's that
that's love

that's love
and that's that


so am I obsessed
or am I in love
whats the difference
when its reciprocated

```
