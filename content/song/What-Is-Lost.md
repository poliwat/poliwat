#### Lyrics

```

what is lost


```

```
whistles ended the lost acid tapes
substance left
as substances filled my stream

no one freestles
stopped before I started

you
fern and her man were having issues

the jokes I made were too crass

bahahahahaha

too hard !!!

too hard for you!!!!!


everyone is falling asleep

ginas making tomato soup

I'm just writing enough

to not feel bad about playing zelda

cause I just danced the night away

so only thing to say

in the end is I miss my friends

and love the times to have new ones

like I never met Gi(Geuremo)

like I don't know what the fuck

the other guys name is

that fernanda is married too

CHRISTiAN!!!!

yes I met him now

and after it's all said and done,

there was nothing left

but the laughs of the night

and I just want to

funny 

```
