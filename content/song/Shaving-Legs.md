##### Key: G major

#### Lyrics

```
walking waiting sleeping keeping,
things close to my chest
you can always lie on my chest when you’re feeling stressed
or when you’re feeling blessed

but london brides london bridges london bridges fall (hahaha)
london brides london bridges london bridges fall

Shaving legs
I sense change
You don’t shave your legs
nearly as much as you used to

and seasons change
and hell you look great
but don’t rely just on your looks girl,
cause that is lame

oh and we go and play twister in the middle of the night
and after 3 -4 beers we’re having a fight
because you want to play some monopoly
but be with me girl I’ll monopolize your (pussy)

I come in late at night
you look stunning, when the lights,
when the lights are not so bright

one step two
grab myself a drink
while you are watching TV
there’s a man on the screen

he’s telling me things I should eat
and also medication so I can digest those things
but is that man on the screen gonna
fix what’s between you you you you and me

fuck it go

You want to play some sudoko
I only want to connect the dots
You talk to me about about getting old
when's your birthday, I forgot

shutup, and seize the day girl
cause there's way cooler things
than a guy with a guitar

Let’s quantify now, our biology
I’m made to spread out and breath
You’re made to instigate like a lobotomy
Shutup and dance girl with me

And Eukaryotes are always getting old
But Forgive me but we’re getting old
And forget everything that you were told
Let go of those memories that you so desperately hold

You want a piece of, my soul,
anything to save you from getting old
and whats left of mine, I've gotta keep,
like old pictures, of young faces,

so shutup, and seize the day girl
cause there's way cooler things
than a guy with
a guy with
a guy with
a guitar

```
