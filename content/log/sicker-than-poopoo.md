I'm so sick
the sickest
sicker than a dog
sicker than poopoo!

I can barely sit up straight

been a good slave today
making beats in chads room
his parents are gone

and a thought occurred to me
what if my future love
is able to read this?

this is the first time I considered this. Should I write you a message?
If I do it wouldn't be that easy to find...

anyways
after paul's b day on sunday I got super sick
I cann't believe its wednesday

Monday and tuesday Zelda saw just me.

I am beating the game on master mode, kicking ass.

This is the first day back to music

I haven't been able to think straight, so I haven't been journalling. However historically this makes me a hippocrit becasue there are plently of logs when I'm out of my mind.   

These 2 beats are coming along nicely,
made mostly last night and this morning
1 made only this morning - here it is....


As always, chad did the drums ü•Å

*422 pm*

I was given the opportunity to piss on a cat, and I declined.

chad's hoooking it up with the sick rememdy stuff

My mom was just pissed about me not being able to clean the room out so I am sick here instead.
We hungout with Ashley and Sean last night, it was sick.


my friend met the president of mexico
in the same conversation that he told me he also talked about a fat orgy he participated in, and that makes me think the president of mexico has his orgy on his hands. LOL


its basically time for zelda I can't make another track I'm too fucked up
sicker than a dog

I can barely type
