**Thursday 305 PM**

In the first hour of hanging out with this old indian dude in the sun by the jacoozi, I got a real sad spell. I became attached to him too quick, and thought how he doesn't have much time left. It made me so sad, because the light in him shines brighter than anyone I've seen here.

We shared a spliff and talked about everything. He affirmed that life is but a stage.

C chang is coming over at 5 pm
