Didn’t get soaked till the end of the pier&hellip; so dropped helcat off at grover beach train station, walked pismo and got to the end of the pier. I read the letter freewrite I wrote on the plane from chicago when I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was going to make it to my dad in time. Well I fucking made it and he made it one more month and I was there all the time and slept in the room and felt beyond horrid on the couch at myself for not giving him mouth to mouth in his last moments when he said he couldn&rsquo;t breath, and I just fucking hate myself for it and the fine line between hating oneself and loving oneself someone tell me cause I walked pismo without a mind just lead by the theatre of my feet, my feet as a submarine after it rained there, me in all black 3 layers of cotton.

I came here to help dad, I was hoping to stay a few weeks, maybe up to xmas to show support and for us to grieve together. It's too short a time to rent somewhere else in the area, and I need to be in the city to move my career forward.
