*Friday 1:21 PM*

Focus.

It's been a slow start, but well done.

Listening to the Modern Architect, a show I may help produce at KZSU. I'll see their process on Thursday and see what's up.

God saved me because someone off of letgo bought my loaded longboard deck. When I'm rich I'll get one again.

Last night auditions went well - but I am getting off topic lately. Last night I went all out into a Davinci resolve editing tutorial, because Rob recommended I try to forget about premiere and final cut. It's super fun but I really need to focus. These are the three things I need to work towards

1. Poliwat
2. TSS
3. Omari

Omari is the bread winner

Had a job interview for being a tutor yesterday and it seemed to go well. I wasn't a complete weirdo.

So Deadlines and Dailies for these three things


#### Poliwat
Deadlines:

*Friday 528 PM*

Listening to drunk shaman has never been more fitting.

Waiting for caltrain.

While scooting the other day, I was cracking up to some old tape. There is a lot of tape that won't ever make it on here, because it would come at the expense of relationships. People trust me with sensitive tape because they (hopefully) know that I wouldn't share anything they wouldn't want shared about themselves. This is some of my favorite tape.

I will never get use to the deadliness of public transit


*Friday 905 PM*

At noisebridge with Stefan

working on poliwat stuff

Active Low is a common thing in electronics
where all the buttons are set ON and when a button is pressed it shorts the ground and becomes disconnected.


-===--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=sat 2:19 AM -=-=-==--=-=

it is the knowledge that I'm going to die
that creates the focus
that I bring to being alive
the urgency of accomplishment
the need to express love
now
not later
if we live forever
why even get out of bed in the morning
because you always have tomorrow


I fear living a life
where I could've accomplished
something I didn't


be ashamed to die
until you have scored some victory for humanity


needed to live
