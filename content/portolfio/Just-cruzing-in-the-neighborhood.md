```
Capo 4 and Cmaj7 to start then you can figure out the rest if you want to play this low hanging fruit
just cruzing in the neighborhood
just boozing in the neighborhood
just losing the neighbors
now look good now look good
postabout it
post about it
now look good

she doesn't go outside
no mirrors outside
this hottie isn't outside

then she ends up in a pile
now look cute
now look cute
post about it
now look cute
post about it
now look cute

(breakdown)
(verse 3 b)
daddy says shutup
make no mistakes
and get straight As
that's how you were raised

but
but we combed the streets
and we combed the lakes
and we combed our hair
looking for you

your parents are worried
you didn't come home
your parents are worried
you didn't come home
make no mistakes
make no mistakes >

just cruzing in the neighborhood
just boozing in the neighborhood
just losing the neighbors
now look good
now look good
post about it
now loo good
post about it
now look good
```
