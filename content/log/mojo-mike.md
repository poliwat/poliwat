@NB ==

Slept in the theatre last night with pero. The whole TSS crew did tech rehearsal until like 3 AM - so matt and I just crashed there. It was a good move, cause I was able to wake up early, drive over and buy a go pro hero 4 off Kyle from letgo, and get some footage. Had a nice talk with a man at a lablabyrinthrythnh outside some real nice cathedral close to Pine street. His name was Bruce.

You know it's a good day when your computer can't keep up with you.
