**Sunday 803 PM**

My granny's hometown. I can't wait to go there.


I walked home in about an hour and 30 from campus, listening to tape from yesterday and reading 12 rules for life.

The only reason I have jordan peterson's book is because Bean happened to have it and she brought it over. Cas Katie Celia Simone came over at 9 with a live chicken and we took it to the chapel. I watched Katie kill it with her bare hands, it was the first chicken she's killed. She practiced the manuver we googled on my hand, and it hurt. You can't really get out of it. During that moment of silence when Katie as about to kill the chicken, I wanted to scream STOP like the end wedding scene in _The Graduate_. But I didn't because I wanted to see if she would actually kill it. How many humans / creatures have died because no one in the group said anything, because they wanted to see if the killer would kill?
  After she cut the chicken's head off with my buck knife, I put it on a nice random page in Jordan Peterson's book.

  Today is the day I submit to Jordan Peterson. And I do this becasue this last month has been bad. I know I'm cosmically behind schedule.

  This last trip trip with lucy hunter lupe koa max and bridget was real educational. But I failed in many zones, and don't have much good audio.

  But what I do have, is the new direction.

  It is here and now that I submit myself to rehab. I will finish my behavior manual for myself and a workable version of poliwat - then hit the road and be a modern day ronin or sorts.

  I'm on the road to becoming a master

  The journeyman is called a journeyman because they live in the journey. If we imagine life as a sacred circle, then the journey is a method to traverse circles over a period of time. This is where the journeyman is on the road to becoming a master.

  Where am I

  Who am I

  Why am I

  When am I

  What am I

  and then wayyyyy down the line - pay off actual debt with art


  I feel focused.

  Now I'm all about using science to make art towards improving humanity. Using that science to make art
