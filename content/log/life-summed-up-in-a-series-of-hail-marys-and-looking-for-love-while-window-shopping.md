ALright alright alright I'm behind schedule, like aslways.

I'm Always late.

And that's fine, but check it out!


Just got back from Nipomo last night with craig in my dad's van.

Audio I got back home: Mila drumming talking and trying to sing, bonnie on russian/french/tlc songs, mom and dad on life, some old mom cassettes she made in 1981.


Why the fuck do messages not send out right now?
