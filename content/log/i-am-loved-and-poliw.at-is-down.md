**Monday 320 PM**


50 music videos

```

i always on coffee and acid and treble

```


sweep yo mamas porch


### 50 shades of mike first music video
### ol' blue eyes


im talking why I saw over this piano tape
why cnat I stop typing to tell any mate
that i tired of living I livid
with the world around me I can feel their suffering


```
when you gotta find you
acapella for my funeral

woke charade

sipping crossfader

```


swwon swoop

my turn okay I'm talking why i sad

over this piano tape
cant cant I stop typing and tell any mate

sweep yo mamas porch
shut the front door
western eastern southern public radio now


athe spread thin
thin out
so focused
sweep P{mamaas porch }

western eastern southern public radio now
sweep yo maama'



50 curse of mike - sleep mike
video time lapses of me falling asleep in public



Im not talking looks
Im talking looks like
I'll need 50 bucks for this piece of art
please
something someone coughs
is something I'd slit a throat guarantee
