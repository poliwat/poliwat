*Sunday 220 PM*

On caltrain heading to noisebridge. I have all my circuits!

I have a light cold, but sweated it out in the sauna @the Y.

Had a good talk with Marion on the phone walking back home and around San Mateo.

*Sunday 741 PM*

noisebridge is going well I love these people, this space, everything. I would hate SF if it didn't have noisebridge. That's because on the 1.8 mile walk here from caltrain, I keep seeing crackheads and teslas in the same space. There's a huge homeless problem here.

Ben let me use his 3.2 teensy and the tutorials are awesome. Made a playlist of Russian songs to put on my phone and have been working to that. Also Debussy, Rachmaninov, Bach.
