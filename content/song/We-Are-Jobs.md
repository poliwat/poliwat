##### Capo 4 C E Am F(Fm)

#### Lyrics

```
(chorus)
we are jobs
what do you do
and by the way
let me do mine

97 floors of jobs
no window in my sisters office
I had a job but I lost it

mom saw an ad
say wouldn't it be nice
if my son drove me in his car
to his house
to his wife

(chorus)
we are jobs
what do you do
and by the way
let me do mine

living in revelations
unemployment soaring
if jobs were songs
Ive got thousands
(chorus)
we are jobs
what do you do
and by the way
let me do mine


dad works full time
no paycheck in a month
keeps giving me razors
I keep losing

brother is a teacher
wearing his shoes
says moon landing's fake
he's on youtube news

students say Earth is flat
don't know what to do with that


but i dont need any shoes

(chorus)
we are jobs
what do you do
and by the way
let me do mine

my sister is a stoner
she dance real good

the buildings have antenna's
how has no one noticed
how things affect us
outside our hearing


they don't want me with my acid eyes

told food stamps lady
if I had a 9 to 5 I'd die
owe my girlfriend 1000 dollars
but wrote her five songs
haven't recorded any of them

what's a girl to do?
life is short art is long
saying we are jobs.....

I got six jobs I get high
if jobs were songs
(don't get me wrong)

job, ? what else am I going to do
I'm going to go to work
what else am I going to do?

(chorus)
we are jobs
what do you do
and by the way
let me do mine

```

## not below this line

```
I could be anybody
but was
born to make music

and his kid
serve me up a coffee

wouldn't that be nice
but all I got is this song
```
