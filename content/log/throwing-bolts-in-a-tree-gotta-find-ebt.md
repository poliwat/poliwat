outside with kenzie KETO DIET DAY 3

we had omelettes - sooooo gooooood.


I lost my passport and have been searching high and low for it. I think I'll tackle Ben's car again in search. But it feel like it's in vain.


I really need to get groceries and am completely out of money, and have no phone.  

My laptop crashed the other day but I managed to fix it last night. The radioshow is tonight and I really need to construct an outline right now stat as well.

The verdict: I need a new battery for my laptop -



lost my EBT

Alright one thing at a time. First off I'm going to finish the outline in ableton for the show.
