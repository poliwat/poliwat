Mom is babysitting Mila for the first time. She likes Raggae

It's time to go back online. I've been sick since Monday, and still have a nasty cough. I feel weak and fat.

Going to retroactively share what happened on the off days, and finally work on poliwat.

My Zelda botw binge has been relentless. I love storming Ganon's castle and hunting down lynels.
I want to make a music video with actual gameplay on something. But I need a special device to record the switch currently. I want to find a way to do it for free. In the meantime it is seriously time to start making money off beats.

You're either growing or you're dying. I grew on my zelda skills this week for sure.



Found what I can use to explain [poliwat](https://codepen.io/michaelflops/pen/JygMra)

Perfect!
Too many things to do. I hate being on dayQuil it makes me stupider. Not being on a healthy ecosystem of drugs makes me stupider too.

I'm like an old man
this is what it will be like
and for years I'll have to work like this
god damn mortality
god bless it


But we need to break this down and prioritize. I'm starting with an official poliwat release schedule.

Rough talking about projects first.
Github needs to be complete by the time I hit san mateo
Jimmothy Leary needs to be complete by then as well. (a linkable album with art to venues and stuff)
Illest Village  - beat inventory and posting of all beats on dedicated accounts
