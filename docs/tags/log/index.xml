It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a hot minute between logs here. 1 week? 1 year? 1 life? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how long it&amp;rsquo;s been it&amp;rsquo;s happening again, as cycles educate. This time round run run and found nothing but self introspection factoring every poor sap in my presence holding back enough to not let on I&amp;rsquo;m socio, as if it&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing to be socio opinionated. Bring me someone with the attention span as I.</description>

Kinda like the &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t completely exist until your &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo; in every possible universe is in conversation
oh ye whose says I s no I s as anything to do with my body, I reckon.

      <description>@ LA museum where jack and I danced years ago
surprised he called it a treasured memory.
Me and Helcat ate at cantor&amp;rsquo;s and god damn I had the pastrami reuben and have been high ever since. Real
I like these swivel chairs more than that art on the walls
oh this will fuck us up
always talking enthusiastically about how something&amp;rsquo;s going to fuck me up, like this black Yerba Mate Tea, this lavender spray, this homemade kombucha.</description>

Didn’t get soaked till the end of the pier&amp;hellip; so dropped helcat off at grover beach train station, walked pismo and got to the end of the pier. I read the letter freewrite I wrote on the plane from chicago when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was going to make it to my dad in time. Well I fucking made it and he made it one more month and I was there all the time and slept in the room and felt beyond horrid on the couch at myself for not giving him mouth to mouth in his last moments when he said he couldn&amp;rsquo;t breath, and I just fucking hate myself for it and the fine line between hating oneself and loving oneself someone tell me cause I walked pismo without a mind just lead by the theatre of my feet, my feet as a submarine after it rained there, me in all black 3 layers of cotton.</description>

      <description>Dear mom and bonnie, I love you, I want to support yo both, but I&#39;m clearly adding stress to both of your lives. I came here to help dad, I was hoping to stay a few weeks, maybe up to xmas to show support and for us to grieve together. It&#39;s too short a time to rent somewhere else in the area, and I need to be in the city to move my career forward.</description>

finally a timestamp
\
that was a month where dtme
didnt exits
 death was life and life was death and they were locked together in an eternal mad lmove battle and this was the final word and the meaning of the world and thence came a radiance that could glorify all misery and thence came a shadow that trumpeted all joy and beauty but from out of this darkness joy burned more intimately and more beautifully and love had a deeper glow within this night -from flute dreams by herman hesse (Strange news from a another star)  </description>
