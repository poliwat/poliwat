Excerpt from 'Letter to no one':

To the lover who didn't love me back,
To the Driver that hit me and ran,
To the Fedex that dropped me and left,
To the volunteer that charged me and quit,

Bots are everywhere but we forget all the time.

# Great, I love this hard look we're about to take.

So the dailies I'm taking more serious and have had success for a few days. More than enough time to CHANGE THE DAILIES!!!
Who said you can't change dailies? My dailies are packages, subscriptions, booster packs! Pay girlfriend back! Operation make dad proud. Operation pay girlriend back. Can I do it? Is it possible optimize all my dailies to a faster trajectory on that money love angle? Let's just use as little words as possible for the question, then hop skip jump drop L cooz friend.

I'm a kid
born in a world that doesn’t make sense

but we’re given balloons and sticks

while we're made to make sense of the world

so right now playing river survivor  

it's sensible to have a lot fun with everyone around

it makes sense to direct all the kids
to go build a boat out of a leaf and a stick

and then eat kid needs to find a worm

and then we launch them down the stream

to see which one survives the longest

and none of the worms ever survive

while the kids laugh the whole time
