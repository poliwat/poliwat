#### Lyrics

funny making jokes at wrong time  (I Know)
<br>funny she saying it not funny right (I Know)
<br>funny I DGAF making jokes all the time (I Know)
<br>wrinkles on my face from smiles right (I Know)
<br>Gods greatest creation was music
<br>Satan's greatest was the word of god
<br>my greatest hasn't happened yet
<br>slipped through my fingers (  ...like my God)

<br>I'm in the maze
<br>I got the faith
<br>polecat in the bay
<br>I'm barefoot
<br>by dog beach
<br>under oak tree
<br>by dog beach
<br>last act going down

<br>speakers blowing out
<br>music all night
<br>got a set at dawn
<br>but am I in front
<br>behind curtain
<br>met the cutest nuddhist budhist
<br>spat ee cummings to me
<br>now she work in tech
<br>and she taught me this chant
<br>nam miyo narang ey quo  (x2-4)
<br>(chorus)
<br>fuck we all audience
<br>I'mma push every human up on this spaceship
<br>let challenge be our only addiction
<br>I'm not alone I'm not alone
<br>we just outnumbered go home
<br>(verse 2)
<br>funny making jokes at wrong time
<br>funny she saying it not funny right
<br>funny I DGAF making jokes all the time
<br>wrinkles on my face from these smiles right
<br>every day and lord knows best
<br>and I may lay to rest
<br>feel max feel max
<br>why
<br>cause I spit by blood
<br>sing on my bones
<br>and wanna sweat
<br>under a tree
<br>by dog beach
<br>under a tree
<br>by dog beach
<br>speakers blowing out
<br>working a pot farm
<br>to flip by the ounce
<br>here in santa cruz
<br>met the cuttest buddhist
<br>spitting ee cummings to me
<br>and satans greatest was
<br>the word of god because
<br>god too pure for man's tongue
<br>god more than man's words
<br>god spoke to me twice
<br>not a word was spoken right

```
Im in the maze
I got the faith
polecat in the bay
Im barefoot


know your audience
fuck that
you need more challenge
we all that

last act going down

speakers blowing out
music all night
got a set at dawn
am I in front of or behind the curtain

met the cutest nuddist budhist

spat cummings to me

under oak tree

by dog beach

now she work in tech

taught me this chant

now i cant pay rent

but was born a betts
and Satan's greatest was
the word of god because

god don't fuck with man's tongue
god more than man's words
god spoke to me twice
not a word was spoken right
get it get this

he fucked with matrices

cmon you're old enough
to see past factions
young enough to make it
I'm dancing naked
not even nervous

know your audience
fuck that

need more challenge
we all that

//God took me to the sun
//where I met the others
```
