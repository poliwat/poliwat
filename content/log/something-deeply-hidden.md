**Friday 10:35 AM**

Well now it's :59...

Really going through a rut...

I can't admit what's happening even in poliwat.

The key to naviagting with reality is to not care. Not care in a sense that you're able to allow eveything to happen to you.

Poliwat is the one way I can organize my mind, and ensure that I'm on the right path. Yesterday I attempted to smoke as much weed as I possibly could. The music went well but it was stoney unorganized jam city.  


I'm stressed I have


I will say everyone is trying to suck my dick right now and I'd rather get better at my skills before

Ahaha hey sorry for the late response - I've been going through crap off the grid at my house... I really appreciate the compliments! Ahaha I felt horny at some point while we were hanging out, but it's probably best if we don't :) - I'm looking for stability atm  


It's rainy so I'm going to make rainy day music I think.

I'm going to enjoy hanging out and cleaning my room I think too.

I'm gong to enjoy doing laundry in the rain
