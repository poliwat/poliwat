Thursday 2:17PM: Getting a very slow start to working, spent the morning needing to be quiet because Gina was using my h5 doing ADR with someone in her film.

Coolest shit right now is bluefluke's psychonaut guide on deviant art. Love it so much.
Trying to get a switch for the flight to Cali on Monday. So it means I have what 4 days of a media cart marathon before I leave :D .

Going to do tomato timer lists I think, and right now come up with FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS

was brb Loading the footage from last night on becca's glyph off her laptop. There's so much to make I may as well spend 25 minutes on a pre production list then churn out a lot not stalling too long on any one thing. Just get as close as I want it in a reasonable amount of time and then iterate over later.

DaVinci on Windows for title screens and 1-4second golden cuts

VDMX for live mixing two chanel videos with third video down the center

#### Step 1

Travelling will be a big

The longterm (2month or so) goal is to run a 24 7 livestream of the poliw.at loves you multiverse, where it's always running and then scheduled out I over take the channel and do a live on top of the live stream thing.....

#### step 0.
- make generic assets folder (savage best of the best of my foot)

#### step 1.
- make folder called assets
- make note sheet .txt

```
Title:
Duration:
Dialogue:
etc....
```

#### step 2.
- hand pick all video and audio into new assets

#### step 3.
- find and look at reference material

#### step 4.
- dont give a fuck about reference material

#### step 5.
- from generic assets folder
- import title from title template in Da Vinci

#### step 6.
- make anything no rules
- aim for what I'd like to experience when I click on that title and see that duration

#### step 7.
- bounce with digit in front and make 1000 for practice, take and use the best ones for the 24/7 live stream show. But first make a bunch in this pattern workflow wise.

- always make moves towards the best bounces falling in Hop Skip Jump Drop L Cooz Friend
