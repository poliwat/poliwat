I&rsquo;ve been thinking about my radio show starting in a couple weeks.
First off, the tape that I play on the show all needs to be Greenlit. I&rsquo;ll get the clips I want to play in playlists, then send individual tracks to people so they can hear exactly what&rsquo;s up.

                             Alright I admit it. Your twenties is the time for colossal mistakes. At the ripe young age of 25, I have made some of my largest mistakes over the past 3 months.
1. Credit Don&rsquo;t live off a credit card ever again, ever. 2. Art No one cares about your art, no one cares about you until you &lsquo;make it&rsquo;  **My mistake was**  3. Here they are, and what I am to do.

Cuz Miles sent me this (solid way to start the day)  @ Starbucks in San Mateo. Just got in last night - Jack and I did TSS rehearsal at the KZSU station. Jack&rsquo;s dad is here! Lexi just showed up before I left as well.
I packed the vehicle up with music equipment I&rsquo;m starting to sell on letgo.
I take solace in writing. I&rsquo;ve been lost without my writing.

Best YT comment I&rsquo;ve seen AHAHAHA
I've been programming for 19 years. People think creating AI with self modifying code is really difficult when the development of AI has only been limited by CPU power. Its actually quite easy, that's why its so scary. Genetic Algorithms are mostly a copy paste job, the only programming that is required is figuring out the heuristic. They are extremely simple by virtue of the fact that it can basically start with nothing and will always eventually get the result you want in a semi brute force fashion, the only factor is time.

I spent extra time in bed meditating. The mantra I repeated was
I will not be self destructive  Where am I missing the mark and why can&rsquo;t I function in society?
Because society is sick. Society is disgusting. How do I overcome my disgust? I finish by first book. That combats the disgust.

When I woke up I saw a daisy And it reminded me of when I was a kid When I was 13 I got my mom flowers to Valentine&rsquo;s Day I didn&rsquo;t have any money so I stole them from Walmart My mom found out I stole them and Took us both back to Walmart She had me return the flowers to the manager and she gave me money to buy her flowers And she said This is how you buy flowers

I feel like trash, and rightly so. I accidentally backed up my bus into Todd&rsquo;s side door when I was realigning it for the lift.
All shop trust was wiped at that.
I&rsquo;m writing a schedule tonight, and am going to nail these projects.
This is the place for the schedule at first, and it will be moved to a calendar.
I have been writing a lot in other places outside of poliwat&hellip; I have a full SD card of fresh audio collected throughout the last week.

Dear parents,
I declare myself in a state of emergency!
I have managed to shower, eat well, work and play so far. Today is day 1 of complete sobriety.
We are having this meeting because you expressed concern. That&rsquo;s great! Because I could really use some help.
One must listen before they help, so I wrote down an overview of my work.
I feel overwhelmed, and you will soon see why. 
                          </p>

Haven&rsquo;t written much in poliwat because I started a secret project I can&rsquo;t talk about. I&rsquo;m publishing a book anonymously, it has 10,000 words so far. Wrote it all in one all nighter last Friday night. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll say about it.
The piano has been drinking. The audio I got yesterday:
2-3 people moved my recorder while it was in place. Ahahahaha too bad.

Philip Wadler is here talking about Haskell. I ate too many mushrooms and tried to piss in an empty starbucks cup while stefan and I drove through the city, but he hit a speed bump and I got piss all over myself. I&rsquo;m wearing his clothes :)
This poliwat shit is really my dumping grounds. It&rsquo;s the one space where I can unleash everything. Other social media sites suck a phat chode.

Find myself on caltrain again. The bandages on my hands make typing more difficult. I think I&rsquo;ll take them off here, cause Matt said they should air out. met a cool circus dude on the ferry from san rafael to SF.
It was great catching a couple rainbows and balancing in the wind, an app Mile&rsquo;s had told us we were going 45 mph.

Just got off the phone with Tom Dioro, and on the caltrain. Heading to Noisebridge to build up my MIDI controller.
The meeting with the marketing director of Beats by Dre got postponed to next Tuesday. It&rsquo;s interesting, a couple days ago I didn&rsquo;t think I could make it until Wednesday.
But now I&rsquo;m amped, these are the 3 things I&rsquo;ll do today
Laser cut panel for MIDI controller project DONE TSS workshop GIF work Make a video for Ben NOT DONE  My knuckles won&rsquo;t stop bleeding.

Spent the morning finishing Joey&rsquo;s site, then working on the innovators podcast. Both are basically done, and I need to more my body. I&rsquo;m starting to freak out. Going to go swim 1 mile and workout in the sauna.
I wish I could find my lucy
333 PM
Worked out real hard at the Y.
Someone stole my goggles in the locker room while I was in the sauna warmup before swimming.

On Caltrain heading to Aren&rsquo;s talk. Listening to Avery&rsquo;s mixes.
I got great tape last night but can&rsquo;t share it on here. After Asim dropped me back home from NB at abou 1130PM, I realized I left my lappy. He picked my dumbass up a second time and we drove all the way back to grab it, because in his words &ldquo;You told me your laptop was your life&rdquo;.

 Asim picked me up from Stanford after I got a little tape reading TSS, and on our way to NB he took me to a place called Scrap, and it was fucking sick.
Purchased the case for my new Midi controller, it&rsquo;s going to be made using the extra parts I&rsquo;ve accumulated. I&rsquo;m drawing out the schematic and laser cutting wood for the thing. In a 3D printing / Modeling class here at NB and it&rsquo;s about to get started.

On the southbound train and forgot to buy a ticket so I&rsquo;m scared shitless in my seat. I hope today is my lucky day.
Fortune Favors the Bold  The Federal Beat Reserve is the name of the folder where Avery and I will add tracks to show Tom, who will allow for the outro of each show. It&rsquo;s fun stuff. Avery came up with the name.

 I&rsquo;m in a lousy mood, don&rsquo;t want to be awake right now. But on the caltrain heading to the Stanford Radio station to help Tom (tim?) with a new show he&rsquo;s putting on. Also we&rsquo;ll talk about what he wants with the website, he may be a client.
Spent the morning writing for Celia&rsquo;s choir, it has consumed me.
Notable progress on paradiddles.

workbench pic Ran to caltrain carrying 30 pounds across two packs and a plate of pasta. Barely made it!
Spent the morning writing for the choir
The hole in my intestines deepened at the purchase of another train ticket on my credit card.
I&rsquo;m writing music as if my life depended on it.
How can I do this quicker?
Writing the voicings using just simple operator in Ableton, quantizing, then importing that midi to musescore.

Waiting for caltrain
Talked with my sister and we 3 way called my mom, trying to schedule a time to help dad clean out the garage while I was there. I wanted to show Bonnie and my dad the app Letgo (the new craigslist) so they could easily get rid of stuff and make a couple bucks on the side.
My mom wasn&rsquo;t having it and said she didn&rsquo;t want issues with me so I hung up on them.

Focus.
It&rsquo;s been a slow start, but well done.
Listening to the Modern Architect, a show I may help produce at KZSU. I&rsquo;ll see their process on Thursday and see what&rsquo;s up. https://www.themodernarchitect.org/on-demand-episodes
God saved me because someone off of letgo bought my loaded longboard deck. When I&rsquo;m rich I&rsquo;ll get one again.
Last night auditions went well - but I am getting off topic lately. Last night I went all out into a Davinci resolve editing tutorial, because Rob recommended I try to forget about premiere and final cut.

On caltrain
feel great
but the debt credit card pit is enveloping my soul
I&rsquo;m working hard straight through it
the city is hardening me
last night a bum came up to us and I bummed a smoke off him and gave him the last of my cash. It reminded me of some song I wrote a while ago where I explain why I give my last bread to the homeless

It&rsquo;s a hard day
But Jack and I hit Bootcamp at 930 and it was a gnarly workout. Ate well and been trying to remove a virus from my lappy. Going to get a haircut, then go to Stanford but I may not at this point because this virus shit is taking too long. I&rsquo;ll work on music, the track to be released this Friday.
I haven&rsquo;t seen Jack wash a single dish since living here

This is the new me. Made everything on my soundcloud private except for the Marquettequette album so my family can hear it.
I have 1 new deadline. 1 track a week, to be released every Friday. That&rsquo;s it. Other than that I am looking good.
4 cute Spanish women want to hangout tonight in the city at bars, I&rsquo;m not sure if I should go.

A speaker tells a listener what someone did to get what he wanted and why.
Once a character has a desire, the story &ldquo;walks&rdquo; on two &ldquo;legs&rdquo;: acting and learning. A character pursuing a desire takes actions to get what he wants, and he learns new information about better ways to get it. Whenever he learns new information, he makes a decision and changes his course of action.

There&rsquo;s a fat gap in the log right now. Moving to San Mateo has been a little life changing, and when life&rsquo;s good I tend to not write as much. But now it&rsquo;s time to hunker down and focus on a strong tracklist for the poliwat debut.

Enjoying the last night before a season of sobriety. This journals going to get lit.
Jack laid down the law over the phone earlier- I am to not piss his mom off, help clean out the garage, and do a list of chores. Oh and have a check ready for 200 bucks.

I woke up from 3 bad dreams on the trampoline. I&rsquo;m feeling quite lonely. My dad is cursing and is angry about being late to work. The moment he comes home from his job he turns off and veggetizes. We rarely play music together.
Why should I feel depressed? I successfully launched two sites and applied to about 30 jobs yesterday.

I have to have to be honest. Other than logging an audio trail, this diary is a tool for me to make better decisions. It was MONDAY when I started my portfolio site, and now I&rsquo;m sitting here and it&rsquo;s late Thursday morning. I woke up on the trampoline falling asleep to Joe Rogon and Neil de Grasse Tyson. At about 1:20:50 Tyson talks about the importance of the naming of stuff, which clearly explains to me why the Illest Village project works.

Last night I planted some iceplant Paul gave me in my parents backyard. It&rsquo;s always good to plant on the side.
This morning started with a quick look into Samuel Beckett and three Jays. JK, not marijuana but James Joyce, and Jane Austin.
Quick nugs from School of life and my own understanding:
Sammuel Beckett  likes to write around the word 'perhaps' not specific, allowing viewer to make it specific on their own  James Joyce  Everyday losers are just as epic and interesting as rich / heroes / heroines.

 “As above, so below; as below, so above.”
 “Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.”
 “Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.

With my parental units, we are on our way to Bonnie&rsquo;s Birthday dinner at a restaurant named Ember.
My parents watch master chef and eat mcdonalds.
So past 24 hours of poliwat venturing.
 Sean took me to his dad&rsquo;s shop. We opened jars of screws and found enough for at least half the mounting brackets for the sliders / effects racks.   Borrowed a self-powered breadboard from Sean in order to diagnose LEDS, as well as two books on solid state electronics.

I must admit here that I could be going faster. But I got distracted by the school of life&rsquo;s art and Architecture educational videos on youtube.
Good design:[10]  is innovative – The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.

Only listening to Bach because we share a birthday. Ate a quick tri-tip sandwich with a pickle, and made one for my mom.
Since today the world is ending, the only sane task at hand is to do what I love. I will build poliwat, and then travel the world with it. It&rsquo;s that simple. It&rsquo;s not that simple though because although the code compiles, I can&rsquo;t get anything out of the LCD screen at the moment&hellip;

creating aand trading realities as art
life and the imagination is this oric field that surrounds the transcendential object

only poliwat
I have cut off all contact with everyone at this point. I will do the bare minimum communications. The only contact is with my parents here. Other than that I am entering complete isolation with myself and poliwat.
This week is devoted to building muscles, and not just physical.

Woke up very depressed
I&rsquo;m supposed to move to San Mateo today. The plan is to start with getting a credit card at Wells Fargo, so I can rent the uhaul. You can&rsquo;t rent a uhaul without a credit card. Then I just have to pack up whats in my room and head up there. But really I&rsquo;d rather turn off my phone, keep my blinds shut, and work on poliwat.
