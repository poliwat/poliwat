Are you sad because you were fixed?
Don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;d be sad too if I was fixed
But it&rsquo;s for the best.
I wish I was fixed
It&rsquo;s different it&rsquo;s hard but 
Why are you crying?
Because you&rsquo;re not used to this kind of attention?
It&rsquo;s okay it&rsquo;ll get better soon. 
Just relax

<p>Hello city MD collections? Yes I know,
I signed off all this shit when I was having a psychotic episode during the pandemic,
And you manipulated me into thinking the normal yearly flue shot was free, and now you&rsquo;re trying to get me to pay, because my California Obama care didn&rsquo;t cover a YEARLY FLU SHOT? Well I got your shot and immediately fell I&rsquo;ll and couldn&rsquo;t work as a teacher, paid minimum wage maxed part time at a fancy private school by Wall Street. No thank you, you can take me to collections, you can take me to court, but as Benjamin Franklin said,&ldquo;What more valuable than Gold? Diamonds. Than Diamonds? Virtue.”
I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not going to pay you money for making me sick
My virtue stands in tact by standing up against you, your company, your evil albeit legal ways.sorry this is 2022. Evil but legal will not remain. </p>

<h2 id="post-about">Post about</h2>

<p>How much do you trust the government?
Are only conservatives not trustworthy?
The questions </p>

<p>The degree of how much you trust the government.</p>

<p>Ask yourself how many times have you driven and not hit a pot hole?</p>

<p>How many times have you gone shopping and not been robbed?</p>

<p>These are the things we take for granted 
They are because of the government</p>

<p>Here are the reasons to not trust the government</p>

<p>Here are the reasons to trust the government</p>

<p>1 the constitutional rights</p>

<p>2 your personal experience</p>

<p>So if your personal experiences are rough 
Then the macro large scale bigger picture of the government will be in that lense </p>

<p>Because we are reduced to our perception our life experiences
Because we are ants in an ant hill but more complex
Because we have hope at least in the awareness of the concept of free will 
Whichs usefulness is undebatable
It&rsquo;s provided</p>

<p>Another post,
When science is a methodology</p>

<p>The oversimplification of language
Produced pill philosophy
Here are the pills,
Now identify yourself in 1-3,
So now thinking in world views has been efficiently reduced to pharmaceutical terms. Ironic when big pharma is the big NoNo when it comes to 90% of the pills in this rainbow.
But irony was never illegal until now
Sarcasm wasn&rsquo;t illegal until now
Statistics wasn&rsquo;t illegal until it got good
But it&rsquo;s ok we are still early in our history, even 
Rational thought was never truly valued across a whole population</p>

<p>But the fact is most humans sort of go into politics like prom, they have a date or they don&rsquo;t
It&rsquo;s not every day for the majority of the population
And as much as the governments of the world want to box their population, it&rsquo;s like trying to catch butterflies with a fishing line on mescaline.</p>

<p>Which leads to another post
The really marginalized groups,
Black republicans
Latinx Republicans
Transgender people against surgery
Black trans Jewish midgets </p>

<p>Izzy: not at all</p>

<p>Write the calendar the calendars for the year </p>

<p>I gave my psychiatrist a five minute monologue about how I love 5 mg and don&rsquo;t want to increase it and she responds with giving me an increase number of pills and tells me to cut them in half so I can take 7.25 mg after I explicitly said I don&rsquo;t want to go over five for Adderall. Is she a reptilian or just getting paid to push this? Unrelated why shouldld any hospital have a substantial monetary incentive to test people positive for covid, and even more for getting them on a ventilator, and even more fore getting a death in the hospitallike some game show? Here&rsquo;s a list of real doctors I&rsquo;ve interviewed that have a first hand experience with such policies
Is it meta or just monetary </p>

<p>In the about page
The first paragraph
Your born you only have two things to learn
How to orient 
And how to listen
And those take years to master 
And if youre any good at getting s shot of going pro then you never feel like you&rsquo;ve quite mastered them
The point of all this
At the end of the day 
Is obviously to unite humanity 
As a whole a collective
While also min maxing the individual 
Because we all know
The most wise quotes about society involve 
The word people
And so the call to people, the people of any society improving is strong. So the lowest level (based Chinese quote about looking at the root of the issue) is how to orient, and how to listen
The only two skills that make a difference between rich and hobo
Saint and sinner
Soldier and hippy
With all the love i can possibly muster in my bones on overdrive
I love you more than you will ever know
I feel your pain in the most remote moments
And I believe in you without the need for you to do believe or see me in any capacity
There is a big promise of nirvana coming
But the Luciferan philosophy
At the end of the day
In it&rsquo;s root form
Is 
Be silent about misconduct today for the promise of heaven later
And that&rsquo;s why the world is fucked up
There are good people
Allowing bad things to happen every day
With the promise of a better future
 But once the tolerance shifts to tolerating everyone from the white supremacists to the black trans pedos, when it shifts to first seeing the similarities in one another instead of our differences first</p>

<p>Our differences are desert
Differences as desert</p>

<p>Similarities as soup
It&rsquo;s first a first course meal 
From poverty to power</p>

<p>Post about why people are afraid of drugs
Being afraid of drugs is being afraid of one&rsquo;s own minds
Use the parable of the monks in the temple one finds the drugs stash and forces the lower monk to bring the master all the drugs and he ingests them ALL right in front of him and he says master this will kill you and he says no there are no drugs we will meditate in silence now and they meditate together and he doesn&rsquo;t die he barely even sweats 
After consuming a lethal amount of 2-3 drugs simultaneously with a lethal amount of other drugs </p>

<p>God&rsquo;s backyard gets bigger and bigger.</p>
