##### Sept 26th, just babysat Max at whole foods for an hour and a half

Now helen and I are on CTA heading 4 free jazz for the rest of the day => paul told me on the phone the moon landing was definitely fake and he's not afraid of anyone anymore. Pretty woke for a high school history teacher. He said his students are dumb they think the Earth is flat. I told him they will be more what he believes they are, so think and behace as if they're smart. I also told him if the moon landing was fake, do we have a secret base on mars? And for how long? He said he wasn't sure, I never got to ask the follow up cause his mom called. This all happened after playwing from yamaha mini grand electric piano hybrid POS in Marianos. My first time on CTA! I was getting help from a lady on here with huge tits but Helen figured it all out (read this aloud to her) We got some free wine and gin tasting at whole foods and a free bourbon and whiskey tasting on the walk to the train. "You're retarded" She told me with fresh lipstick. She normally doesn't wear lipstick. It's my maps on my ghetto old free EBT phone, all the google suite apps have 'Go' after them, telling me it's becoming more and more impossible to maintain code on old hardware. While watching M my manager's 4 year old my mom texted me she has some skin cancer.

Made it! To the improvised jazz. A dude asked for 2.25 on the bus cause I flashed a smile I told him I've got less than 100 bucks on a debit card. And it's supposed to rain but hasn't yet. I just dosed but Helen didn't want to. Not for the feint of heart! You're going to really wish you dosed for 6 hours of live improvised jazz. We just fot off the train but it feel like I'm on the train of fire ass percussion loops today. When I get a little more Lit I'll take the recorder straight to the front. We know the guy on the left is frying hard, it's not yet 4pm in this church and he's playing with sunglasses on. Damn the chanting came in for a moment - Two percussionists is all I want ay my funeral. Percussion & chanting, the choir doesnt start till dawn. CATHY told me she smoked the sacred pipe at her church. This whole episode I can feel will be a steady he said she said I thought presentation. What isn't

90% white people showed up to the free jazz in the 90% black neighborhood. Who cares for statistics or meter when you get paid to discover yourself,  to investigate further the things you don't understand? Cause real jazz jams from the great masters caught on youtube tell me the best can jam for eternity. Cause that's what they're actually doing. It's a meditation. Like writing. More like freestyling cause when your peaking you know the difference between a week absent of playing and not. nd wen you peaking and freestyling when you know all the words when you know all the rhymes and when you're there, with the microphone that act of improvising allows you to shut off all the wrong sitches and turn on all the right ones at the right times like uh uh what music is in the first place! Right ? Who knows I fell off the flat Earth two pafes ago. It's over too soon, and we gotta move up cause today's like last night => dreams living in the house of music.
