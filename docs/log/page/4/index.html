                             Tuesday 1136 AM
Haven&rsquo;t made a single post, but I work all the time. Some who don&rsquo;t work much post all the time, what am I doing? Why am I not comfortable sharing shit on the interent?
I don&rsquo;t understand my relationship to the web sometimes. I have two comission pieces, less than 100 dollars, I think it&rsquo;s cause I can&rsquo;t record into Ableton right now ||
But today is all about posting || finishing Death Ep with Ted ++ || setting up triggers and finishing the studio and getting a loan || if those three ||

this isn&rsquo;t even the right day but I&rsquo;m just getting caught up in the sauce of it all. just talked to hunter and damn I have been so stupid this last week. I promised him I would live stream tomorrow by 7 pm so that&rsquo;ll be a deadline. it&rsquo;s perfect cause then I&rsquo;ll have that a stone&rsquo;s throw ( one click away ) from paleblue.

find myself @ supreme pizza again cause I my soul needs it. Didn&rsquo;t get home till like 7 am, was hanging out late with Louis and his cuz Kevin. Kevin had 60 pounds on me but we grappled in the alleyway with all the art next to noisebridge and he got me in the end but I made him bleed all over his favorite shirt on accident. Louis used seltzer water to get it out and it worked great.

Ive been handwriting poliwat on this clipboard I spray painted red months ago and it&rsquo;s been a nice calming change of pace. Hands.poliw.at is the new brain dump
but stayed up till like 4-5 am don&rsquo;t remember making this site, and then made the song site too cause that&rsquo;s real needed.

In terms of relevance and time of release this movie was way ahead of its time, considering there is now global awakening, and the human consciousness is expanding faster than before. What was once dismissed as science fiction is now discussed amongst quantum physicists as a plausible theory. And we could possibly live within a matrix.

I got super fire audio yesterday.
I&rsquo;ve been spray painting two song writing clipboards and a lamp I found. I started cleaning my dad&rsquo;s workshop space but realized I didn&rsquo;t have enough time.
this all happened yesterday.
this is day 4 sber and I feel pretty okay - just a lil mad at stuff.
Like the first two days of sober my mom starting saying some dumb shit to me and I normally can play it cool and let her run, but not on these two mornings.

kevin&rsquo;s drunk
criag&rsquo;s outside talking to him
kevin&rsquo;s trying to talk shit on me cause he&rsquo;s being zoned in on by craig, concerned about his drinking.
I&rsquo;m concerned but have strong opinions on what freedom looks like.

Freedom is allowing my friends to submit to any poisons they feel they need to

I am here in this room to do one job only. Finish the poliw.at album. and everything that&rsquo;s a bi-product - part of the journey that it takes to make an album out of range.
by sunday the studio will be finished and chad and I will record in here for the first time. Hopefully kevin&rsquo;s in too. he&rsquo;s been drinking and my parents are trying to get rent from him.

@ mcdonalds and less drunk than I thought I&rsquo;d be at this point. I went on a mission to use all the pain in the house - revamping the studio. Bought kevin and I 4 locos - we&rsquo;re going to rap tonight. Chad isn&rsquo;t coming back today but might tomorrow. Knowing him he will stall one more day - he doesn&rsquo;t seem to want to deal with his mother&rsquo;s passing in his hometown.

Chad&rsquo;s mom died peacefully in her sleep sometime inbetween 7 and 11 AM.
I was sanding this wooden island found by a dumpster while on a walk with my mom this morning, when we saw the fire engine in his front yard and checked it out. There was a cop a healthcare lady and fire guys.
I was the first to call chad, he&rsquo;s in oceanside for a religious holiday.

Tuesdat 741 AM
With v few exceptions, I&rsquo;ve been living the past few weeks only talking with the people that come right up to me in person. I would recommend doing this occassionally - yesterday I hit a new calm while sanding and painting some wood I found in the backyard.
I love working with wood, I could do that all day sober as a bird. The lucy makes it better though.

recording is the only thing I could really lie about easily.
I just got up - wanted to get up at 6:30 AM but didn&rsquo;t have an alarm. I&rsquo;ll hopefully find one in the shed tonight. I will take a sleep aide as well.
Cause what I&rsquo;m doing is building the new routine. No distractions, just the bare minimum dope routine of all the stuff I love.

I&rsquo;ll admit that going back home is helping, although I&rsquo;ve been messing up on the sobriety game.
And it is just a game, cause I know I&rsquo;ll be okay at the end of the day (aka if I affirm that consistently then my chances increase.)
Today is all about remembering things I like. I need to like something more than freestyling!
Like Game theory, you can apply freestyling to everything.

finally made it home so I&rsquo;m feeling a lot better already.
Been wanting to just be here, without distractions for a while now.
its already been super annoying not having a phone - I lost about 10 ideas I wanted to write down today cause I was caught dead in the water, a spot without a means to record.
I&rsquo;ll start carrying a journal around again while I navigate the whole no phone thing otra vez.

barely made it on the amtrack train! well not really had like 15 minutes to spare, but it was real stressful getting here. My phone kept glitching out while I was stuck in traffic on the 17, banking the train being later than myself. Now the phone won&rsquo;t boot, so I get to enjoy the next 5 hours completely by myself. I didn&rsquo;t set up for getting picked up yet, so I&rsquo;ll either find a friendly passenger or hit a coffee shop in SLO and reach out to them over wifi.

 Ironic in that she loves the growlers I pissed and smoked half a cig at Davis after my phone died on the way over.

@ the Abbey.
I&rsquo;ve been not quite functional lately. I must admit. I see Justine my future singing teacher here though and I&rsquo;ll talk with her when she looks a little less busy.
I don&rsquo;t get it.
Did I perma fry ?
Did I really fly too close to the sun ?
Once again I feel like going home. I don&rsquo;t know how to pay rent yet again, due proper in a week (but maybe I could stall as it trickles in)

ok no more lying
had some spliff a few hours ago but not feeling it anymore. I feel a slight buzz off this coffee. Slept in simone&rsquo;s bed cause he&rsquo;s out of town at Hunter&rsquo;s place late last night - called darlene at like 1 am and talked to her for nearly an hour while skating to get a ham and cheese croissant, the first time after 5 attempts to get one at the local doughnut shop Ferrell&rsquo;s.

I&rsquo;m sad I admit it. I&rsquo;ve been sad for like 7 days, with brief moments of clarity. What a waste of time!

Sitting in the trailer on our property on the mountain. It&rsquo;s dirty, needs new apolstery and has a mushroom growing on the inside above the door. I&rsquo;ve never lived in a trailer before. I don&rsquo;t mean to wallow in existential, cause that kills time.
I like the sounds here. There&rsquo;s two crows having a distinct conversation. I need to calm down. I woke up with a lot of pressure in my head.

In kenzie&rsquo;s car - we&rsquo;re mobbing to replace my EBT card then getting hella keto vegtables.
we broke keto since the last fern gulley party. Then we&rsquo;re picking up niko and doing monday volleyball at 4!
Been real depressed since the day before the party and beyond. The part was super nice though.
I just have been going hard on the paint, I just feel too many turbulent emotions sometimes.

I played a live set at the third fern gully installment, it was sweet.
I britney spears&rsquo;d it. I made a 30 min music video / ableton mix. I didn&rsquo;t do any live looping like I wanted but did had a nice ratio of 40% written and 60% freestyle throughout the set.
The reception was real next level - people really loved that shit. I&rsquo;m definitely on to something I don&rsquo;t understand, and I don&rsquo;t need to.
