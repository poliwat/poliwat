I always wished I grew up in a household like this. I wanted nothing more than a laptop since the age of 6, but didn't get my hands on a computer until some extreme manipulation in seventh grade. I got a shitty Dell that would run World of Warcraft at 12 FPS in Ogrimmar or Dalaran. I was an incredibly annoying lock for a while but my real soul was ganking, dueling and general pvping as an undead rogue.

Growing up I always wished my parents were more affluent, challenging, and driven. It wasn't until the time I left for college that I became truly okay with my upbringing. It's incredible what a 4 hour drive distance will do to your relationships. I'll include a photo of my parents when I get to their house sometime tomorrow afternoon. This is my journal, and I just needed to have a separate entry for something that is quite a real aspect of my life. I don't believe I can ever be a good programmer. I didn't do well in math classes as a kid, and even in college got a 'D' in Calculus. Twice.

What I did learn however is the feeling of unrequitted, unconditional love. My parents have always allowed me to explore the world, and I went from die hard extreme Rush Limbaugh disciple Right wing twat to dumb barefoot hippy liberal all on my own accord. They have shown love to me in times that I was objectively unlovable, and I can feel the power from their efforts every single day.

##### My parents. I'm proud of them


In a couple days I will be in my father's hometown and birthplace

Speaking of love. There is no feeling on the planet like that of a good woman missed. ^&#$%^ broke up with me. She never seemed to experience this unconditional love I feel from my parents. From my view she gave up on my offer of it. However is it unconditional if it expires? She's an intern at [Google](https://google.com) now, making double the money doing what she loves. I got her into programming in the first place, and she sky rocketed ahead. However it came at a cost of interpersonal relationships. She's sort of a creep. Is it unconditional love? At this point in time I can't see her as much more than a parasite with a 10/10 ass.


##### Do what scares you.

Sharing my previous insecurities about my upbringing, and experiences of my last ex scare me.

The two secrets I am going to share will take a while - maybe a month or two.
