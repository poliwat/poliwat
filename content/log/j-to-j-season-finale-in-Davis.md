**Satdat 818 pm**

just drove Brianna's uHaul to Davis. She's treating me to Korean BBQ and the first growler of my life.

```

Ironic in that she loves the growlers   

I pissed and smoked half a cig at Davis after my phone died on the way over.

today saw Paul Stamets
freestyles from Bis Sean Childish Gambino, Hopsin, Logic,

and then I freestyled my heart out.


I wanna collage a music video between myself and
a collage of songbirds and different species doing a mating call

and that's the hook as well

and its like

the whole would you forgive the
ugliest parts about me

idk tho


```

Cripsi and I are doing

```
scizhos know how to correctly behave

whats your fav hike ever
in witners
its so pretty sf

hiking highway one

on trail
off trail
tics tick tock boom
glock in my peripheral
every two steps
I fed up
with knowing what the right way looks like
some problems easy to identify
pattern from gheghis khan mindset I
know smoking on the corner days are ending today
I know juuling on



### google animal mating call videos

```
chad zoom in on my posture
chad Kendall on cam I must her
chad focus on my hunch back
chad locus fix my juul crack
```

```
chad I in an open casket
drawn in sand I look fantastic
in wetsuit looking at watch ( 7 )
timing myself sober in yard ( 9 )
drink drive it a game down boulevard ( 11 )
she toke it fo camera shy girls (  )
on path to good woman we don't deserve

I focus my dream come true
I chase it for truth
I chase it ruth
I dont mean to  
dot com burst yo bubble with truth

Chad I pic a shotlist
cha dlet me first tell the the track list
in order, dont forget
I index from zero
means I count from zero
so track zero is
life a sacred circle
then my number 1 I am a spliff
to my number two world my stage
to my number three she breaking glass ceiling

(comment this is too narcissistic for my taste so imma change the vibe BOOM
  SHE BREAKING GLASS CEILING (SBGC))

  Number four vibe change !!


chad

m: is my batting average higher hers?

chad: your batting average is higher than hers.


```


chad I have some ideas for this song



(five finger of death)^2

25 fingers of death

you have to rap a beat over each person,

reflecting on the person
(per paragragh

  mention past hitory snippet/lesson
  current hot topic item commentary
  autobigraphical and emotional assessment
  joke and prediction of the future)

a freestyle format that if you take a leap and a step, (or a stretch and a reach) this exercise could hopefully be a way to
setup the mind in a good context for assessing the past, present, and future.

^^^^  Shotlist / sketche ideas

```
film in woods, 25 people in total, separated a long a trail about 30 feet apart along the trail and not.

the person has to suck the finger of each person before freestlying about them, then hug em at the end.

(you honestly need to just yeah tap em when the beat starts and hug em after the beat ends )


people on the list to freestyle too

```
chad
kevin
kenzie
muneerah
niko
 { bonnie }
```

```


lessons from rap today

talk about the past present and future


another night I ignore my body
another night I ignore her body
late night I freestyle in the lobby
quick morning I addicted to jovii
flying over my house
in my mind now
flying cars ride my space ship
ace of plays in the plays of ace
house full she on deck
I digress
50 games of chess with this one
you're a wizard
you're insane
I've never seen woman so snark so crass last dance
like whys it so good
like whys everytime we fuck its as if its the last   




she love me cause ui like to talk to everyone

hate cause i talk to everyonr





first mike of 50 shades:

{

dont subscribe
I make these for me
lets crowdsource my psychology
lets get therapy through youtube
lets make our own social media
a movement not a notion
common sense not promise
schizoptypal friend like Thomas
dont trust no ends

first of the 50 shades I love you
this a shout out to all those I love and cherish and behold !

like the best kept secret
we dont have enough resources
to have everyone do what they want
since we on pillow then
blanket statements
most front like they want truth
but prefer
I'm the first to admit






**sundat 604 pm**

still on moving
but when I get back


```
day 1 is assement of body, mind and spirit, with pictures

ics of my scratches
vids of my body

just brutal assesment

```
```



```
the best rappers never talk

they just rap

```




























like def

I dont care about you
cause I too busy
too many things to care about
to many things to cry about



to many reasons to try without


clip of me


}








```
let me show you what you hear
then tell you what I hear
```



bread pasta rice tortillas BUNS
```
###no sugar !!


wh cause I question bukowskis legitimacy
in a moral conundrum picking up a scrip for my mom at the pharmacy
