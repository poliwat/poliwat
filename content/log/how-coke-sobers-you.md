**Frisat 813pm**


wheres my eye sight going

made it all day not eating anything cept 4 table spoons total of sauerkraut. started keto diet today and you enter ketosis quicker if you fast

fast lol that auto correct is a pw for idk what but this is how you can find it I suppose how you spell I can't remember my single english high school teacher's name right now but she showed me frankenstein and I thank you for that ==

in the tent that was supposed to be the first thing, spent the day organizing papers first, have 3 special binders all sorted out now --- songwriting || paleblue || personal development stuff ||

so the logs are there

spent the day cleaning cleaning cleaning cleaning organizing and now I look up oh wait I spent an hour shopping from TJs spent 81 bucks of ebt on all keto food its going to go great

love it I got a new schedule

when you don't have anything / in my case much to lose

then you are

A ) dangerous to your govt (maybe, possibly)  {{{im not}}}  

B ) suspectable to significant mental influence on your psyche, how you perceive the world
((TLDR;if some source is providing a significant amount of answers of why your life is the way it is for you))

C ) you are someone to be listened to

D ) whoever has nothing is who I listen to the most

#### nonsequiter pov

E ) I have 5 bucks I got from my dad's van

did dishes for dad

did weeds for mom

now going to make dinner, goal was to make it to 6 without eating I made it to about that, haven't really eaten yet

and also

you know what ?

I love you , I love you I love you I don t mind when you dont respond because that's healthy and you're at ben's bday so I understand it's la Jolla  love you :D

And she said
