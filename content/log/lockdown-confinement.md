**Monday 140  PM**

I woke around 10 AM. Been soldering for poliwat at my desk, it feels good to get back on it but it's seriously been so long that moral is low. I should soldered this shit months ago. I shouldn't've gotten so high so often. But that's what trap inspires. trap gods are powered by cannibis. It's cannibus inspired music.

This week will see good poliwat logs cause I'm entering the hermit zone. The only thing(s) holding me back is shitty internet and low impulse control.

Often If pages don't load fast enough, I forget what I'm doing.

Moral is also a little low right now for a few reasons.

The makerspace is coming along nicely. Hunter and I have been going ham on discord and we had a bunch of fun making plans last night. But sadly we are losing the car port,

Gwen the wonderful artist

**tuesday 253 AM**

peter pan has just begun on the vcr. Thanks for the keyboard cam it's coming in clutch right now.

I just sang for a long time and worked on I am a spliff grasshopper my grasshopper, reverse.

|| ||| ahahaha talking to Tiffani she read poliwat!!! | | | | |  


I'm on lock down

I'm freaking out

Im so stressed

Blah blah blah

I just stared into the mirror and bounced my erect torso and body looking in the mirror.


Don't tell people about poliw.at

Ahahaha I remember when I said that to Stefan as a joke and he was like OKAY
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I had some good thoughts to share but they left me.

It's because I took too long to get to the laptop. I smoked all the 'infinity spliff' jar as we called it two nights ago.

should I talk about myself

or poliwat

or pale blue dot

or my love life

or fuck you future michael

stop getting so high that you don't document the gems of the day

weak game this week

Go the fuck to sleep, make coffee take a hot shower and wake up and hit it hard and

OH I REMEMBER NOW

I noticed in my behavior, my impulse control has weakened. Dramatically. Impulse is instrumental in music making.

-====-=-=-=--=-
I am broken

but its temprary cause I've been here before

and that's what you do

you contort and change your body

over the course of months or weeks

a bunch of small roles

are developing

the cycle of infinite characters

lives opinions and stories

Help me my phone has been out since idk Saturday and I don't have enough money for it.

But I'm not only terrible with money, I'm terrible with talking about money. And the better my art gets, the worse the money stuff gets. But it's actually looking pretty good because I have a lot of projects that are growing (organically)

I can't talk to anyone. Everyone is distracting me and I am disctracting myself.  vc
