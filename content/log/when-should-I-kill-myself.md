*Thursday 743 PM*

This is the new me. Made everything on my soundcloud private except for the Marquettequette album so my family can hear it.

I have 1 new deadline. 1 track a week, to be released every Friday. That's it. Other than that I am looking good.

4 cute Spanish women want to hangout tonight in the city at bars, I'm not sure if I should go.   


*Friday 321 AM*

On tape, I promised to DJ Christina's birthday in Barcelona this upcoming June. If I don't then I have to make her two albums, where every track is about her.

##I now have 4 reasons to learn Spanish

Had a wonderful night with some new friends <3



also got mixing advice from ian
