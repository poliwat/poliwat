#### Lyrics

Mason Dixon Line by Poliw.at

### guitar capo 1, horse trot

```
Em                              G               C
Crossed the Mason Dixon Line before I knew the line

C
made a bunch of ride or die friends

Em
I cannot find

Em
3 years laster I'm still

writing this song

Homegrown golden hair and a Californian bong

(CH1)
so save me from myself

I sing to myself

I sing to myself

Verse 2
October skies never looked the same again

after Raul through down on lake michigan

To all great friend I make

I can't keep tabs

I love you all x2

CH

So save me
from my
self I
sing to myself
```
