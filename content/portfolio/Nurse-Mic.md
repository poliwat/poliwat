**848AM**

Been real busy how many days now? Been nursing dad he's been on hospice, can't think straight, didn't sleep much or well at all, laptops broken but using teddy's old TV that has an acrylic laser cut sign of robin on it. Just updating this ipod so I can keep nursing well with new tunes. H kissed me back barely and felt sexually dead, she went to starbucks.
