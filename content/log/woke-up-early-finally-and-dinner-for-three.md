**Fridat 753 AM**


Is today the day I successfully block everything out? That I stay sober?

I spliffed with Chad yesterday

what happened to my brain? I can fix it with meditation.
I'll work on the pomodor time schedule today,
with these tasks

```
I'm committed to no more commitments
I'm on my own time
everyone can suck it
and will in

go home christian attitudes if you know

no on knows I making a music video
just watch my video Im serious though



```

**Friday 927 AM**

Okay at least I haven't had alcohol in a while. Def need to start on a keto only diet today.

setting up the studio in the room. It's a little sad that I am already having withdrawals a bit- looks like I went a little too hard on the paint.

Speaking of exess uses of little i


think
```
why

why my parents are plebs
and I never got over it
grover beach getting to crowded
so I hike
or die
cause everything in my life is
do or die
pay your dues
I tell myself
pay your dues
one day myself
will be able to
```



**Frida 959 AM**

Today is the first day I'm sober still this long. Lol it's only 10 AM . I'm making a big deal out of it, I mean being awake for this long without doing some fix. I really grew to hate my house back up in SC - because something wouldn't work then I would get a second wind too early, cause we know it's all about that second wind around 5 pm.

I'm organizing files and this time, it's going to work. I have minimal distractions here at my parents house. I spent the morning organizing files and while when I have to wait for my POS faptop - I have been setting up the studio here. I really wanna throw down on some more gretsch as a reward.

yesterday I spent most of the day helping chad with registering the salvage car title stuff. It didn't go that well and we left it at - in 2 day Tmobile will send me a list of all my phone call history, so that we can try and track down that guy that sold us the car.

I doubt we'll get in contact with him, and I doubt further that he will help us.

But anyways  

will I always feel estranged from society? Cause that's all I know. But then there are so many times when that is simply not the case.

I'm not eating yet because I want to go go keto but there is limited keto food in the kitchen. I think my food stamps re upped today so I wanna go shopping, but don't want to stop working here. So I think I'll fast and then try and go later tonight right before TJs closes.

alright alright I got arcade working

got 40 gigs of shit off my laptop so it's running better

I started on a new Vault 36 master folder for sounds

which I'll then upload

I still haven't talked to anyone back in SC

I'm eloping by myself

just going to be sober in this white room with one whole wall as a mirror

and going to just go ham on churning out music videos.

the simpler the better. If I set parameters then I'll be able to go faster. but damn it's not just about that. I don't know. I'm going crazy honesty to god .

into pillows over past talk I shout


late at night can't sleep on the clock
