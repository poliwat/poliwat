**Wed 2:30 PM**

I submitted to darkness, the past few days have been a blur. I wasted Monday-now. But I had a real nice time having a solid hangout session with Darlene, we hiked around my house and I showed her classified liC.
Addy fucked me so hard I have wanted to kill myself consistently since Sunday.
Also Matt was the worst house guest, but he just got out of a relationship with Kim after 4 1/2 years so it's understandable.



**Wed 330 PM**  


what a sad day, I had to delete my windows partition to make room for all this new audio.
