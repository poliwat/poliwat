Sunday 526 PM

Haven't written much because life has been too good.

In the car with Kevin and chad, we're hitting paul's b day!!!!

Very excited.

I took a bath in a horse troph in my parents backyard.
I got everyone I love all about jimmothy leary.

Last night a drunk guy stumbled upon us and it's still hilarious.


Me leaving my new hard drive in santa cruz was a huge mistake, but it'll work out

it always works out


##### Birthday time!

Too many freestyles.....
Criminally fun

Also got such a VIP special lightshow from Alyson. She spins orbits. She did a light show for me a couple months ago, and in that time she has grown so much as an artist. She's pro now!!!  

 She's going to give me a spinner too when her company gets their 3D printer. I can't wait to do it! It's getting integrated into Poliwat(obvious0101101).
