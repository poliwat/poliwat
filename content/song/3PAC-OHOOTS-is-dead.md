Song about a friend I didn't get a chance to meet on this Earth.

#### Lyrics

```
C    E        F
3PAC 0HOOTS is dead  
G
a friend I

C         E            F
some dumb friend I’m gonna meet

(chords repeat)  
in the next something
to look forward to me
you can find me a lot
by myself in the sunny spot
I’m smoking don’t got another
I just bum em
been bumming for years oh
flying by the seams
more than a habit to me

(CHORUS)
but I said
3PAC 0HOOTS is dead
a friend I never met
something to look
forward to in the next
fuck it I’mma die
a graceful death

but stories don’t end
I wrote in my favorite
book a steppenwolf
by transitive property
friend and I know I woke
I wokeT too hard I
wokeT too soft now
I broke it off
but I said 3PAC
0HOOTS is dead
I broke it off
then we hit the creek
with some cheese and lucy
I told her I would
miss the cheese

but stories don’t end by me
stories don’t end
think of the transitive
property friend
and that’s how I sleep
only when I’m not awake
and I prefer to be
awake all the time
cause I’m about to be 27
now and I don’t sleep
never said I was smart
wise or keepable
but I said
3PAC 0HOOTS is dead
a friend I never met
some dumb friend
I’m gonna meet
in the next something
to look forward to me
you can find me a lot by
myself in the sunny spot
I’m smoking don’t got
another I just bum em
been bumming for years oh
flying by the seams
more than a habit to me
flying by the seams
more than a habit to me

CHORUS
3PAC 0HOOTS is dead
a friend I never met
something to look forward
in the next
fuck it I’mma die a
graceful death
