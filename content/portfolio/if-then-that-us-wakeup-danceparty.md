**1113AM**

on a good one right now, but terbz behind. not going to leave NB aside from body and gear needs.

going to setup PBD tv today and finish all the websites
and won't leave until they're all done

BUT cam is going to smoke a tiny spliff at the top of dolo by the statue at 1130 and I could jog there real quick .... and the sun is shining bright so I might do that quickly cause I left my laptop charger here as well.

Finished the pbd ep1 yesterday and now going do the death one today, a little bit of everything at the same time and it'll work out great cause Im wearing workout clothes. tyler said I looked like an 80s workout instructor, and he'd buy my dvd series.
