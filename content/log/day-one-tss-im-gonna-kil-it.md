Jack lied about the room being ready for me. It was full of stuff, we worked on moving a lot of it out into the garage but the garage is full of stuff so it's going to take a couple days to fully move in.  

Scrubbed the bathroom, cleaned 1 of the two room garage, hit my room, dishes, put screens in the kitchen windows...
got a lot done, now I can workout and work with the new teensy board that came in!

Very excited.

Today is possible because of my most comfortable underwear.

*555 PM*

500 confucious canoes left then I'm done with my list for the day. Fixing up my sites and looking at producing jobs to apply to. There's a few local studios I'm cold emailing too.

The 6 pack is coming in but the pit in my stomach weighs heavy.
