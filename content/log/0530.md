Pinned sarcasm

- I don’t think I’m a real man until I can take care of my family, so this year is focused on that

**Thursday 557 AM**

Woke up around 530 cause the heater got turned on. There's a cool ghost here for sure and I don't mind it.

Two things </a>

The first is that you should be wary. There's a reason why the Mayans called psychedelics the food of the Gods.

It's the responsibility that comes along with those experiences.

The sensation isn't fresh in my head, but the lesson is.

Because you have to know something

^ so look at this, I start the passage my saying two things, then go on to state 4 things. My writing skills have diminished, on account of a few factors. First off I am stressed and can't think clearly. Period.


I got lost in the sauce hard this month.

Also I’m going through a stormy mood and I know why. It was this time last night Asha and I broke up. I’m feeling lonely. I don’t really click with anyone in that way. I knew when we broke up last year that my next girlfriend would be a celebrity

I can't believe it took two weeks to wake up this early. I'm getting so much done! And it's only 9:25.

### have someone read bonnie's letter she didn't read it well:

transcript:
```
mila today you are  5 weeks old

you started laughign and smiling a couple days ago
we are so excited

you like when we make high pitched trilling sounds.

this was the first thing you've ever laughed

this past week I turned 28

its crazy that within one year of my 27th year

you were in my tummy

and now youre bout
it happened so fast

I didnt know anything about
babies until you came along

it feels so natural to care for you

its amazing how women's bodies just know what to do

last week you were up to 9 pounds 8 ounces

your head is so much bigger

and you can push your body up for a bit

everyone just loves holding you


you've had many outings.

You've been to a restaurant a grocery store
a fancy wine bar, both Grandma's houses  
```
