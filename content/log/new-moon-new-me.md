Black coffee next to me though I'm pretty calm

About to drop erin off at kianti's for her shift then kenzi and I will run errands.

I tested the internet today with a direct ethernet cable and still got .4 mbsp upload speed so I'm searching for Scott. We can't get fiber internet here so uh oh . I will have to move if we can't at least improve the internet. It fucks me in many dimensions.

I'm not going to get too high tonight

I got some LEDs but they didn't have the right diodes at SC electronics. So the hunt continues! Oh the search for diodes without money.  

### Set List

```
life is a sacred circle
I am a spliff

I index from 0
internet will not be homogenized
