Pretty productive day. Submitted an album and some tracks to publish online across all platforms through distrokid FINALLY. Becca helen and I are about to head over to see the Dorothy Lange exhibition at the MOMA, then get oysters. I'm such a lucky man, being surrounded by smart cool women basically all the time. Has it's cons though. I was getting a little cabin fever so I jogged too blocks after workhorsing the macbook.
