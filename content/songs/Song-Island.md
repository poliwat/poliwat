Sequel to 'My Social Island'.

#### Lyrics

```
this song exists in isolation

this song has never been compared to any song

this is my song

not my last not my first

I propose this song

lives on in isolation

coconut cacao island

fam became zombies so you can think indecently
notha rep notha mile notha swim
notha mob notha crowd notha lesson imperfect

fantastic weight of nothing
people hear weigh in
this that weightless gym
festhers train only hear
fly everywhere else

feathers bring just scales
for each hair
cause flight on shoulders
tears fly off shoulders   

madlibs for video


```
