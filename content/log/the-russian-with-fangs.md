"
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected. The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but transalate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions." -E.M. Forster


*Wed 411 PM*

Marion gave me 200 for her labor wh

on amtrak

can barely think in spoken word

making music
many
emotions
and cliches
left unfucked

## our neighbor told us about the tiny russian with fangs that hangs in a jar in his garage

```
Lyrics:
suburbia is getting lit, I'm afraid

make a better one
for yourself your fam
make a better one
for yourself your fam

our neighbor told us
our neighbor told us
ith a twinkle in his eye

[chorus 1] x2
the russian with fangs
upside down he hangs
in a jar he hangs

```


people are shit cause they're treated like shit
walk the dog with SUV treated like shit

```

I am the means
and not the end

end of my life
highlife mike life
sewey


```



Romance only dies with life.
No pair of pincers could pull it out of us.
out of me
out of us

unexpected sentiment

unexxpected
I'm a slave to te beat
I don't care who sees it
I am a master of nothing
A master of nothing is the master of everything

I'm stoney glassy eyed

sing praise to the beat
all pigeons off the street

nother uber gone bad
now harrassing with a nissan

cannot resist
A wonderful physical tie binds the parents to the children; and — by some sad, strange irony — it does not bind us children to our parents. For if it did, if we could answer their love not with gratitude but with equal love, life would lose much of its pathos and much of its squalor, and we might be wonderfully happy.


- E.M. Forster

```



what to say to a strange
that tells them
they can stay
they can leave
what they freaking on
what they freaking bout
who they freakin now
who they fuckin be

in the now
not the past
the past a disease
