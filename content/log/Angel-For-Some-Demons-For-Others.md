# Day 1 No More Code Brackets

and don't you want to be like every one man
everyone man?

A ya don't you want to be like everyone ya?

B No

B don’t wanna be like everyone...

Everyone...

Whose everyone?

Everyone

with blown ear drums,

blown ear drums and rectangle thinking!

Life through a box, you find their boundaries too much. Can’t talk about the real shit.

Everyone's got a smart phone

a radioactive shackle  

a rectangle on their mind

your mind

a box a smart phone

Everyones got boundaries

Man constantly bumping into them

Everyones got boundaries

Man constantly bumping into them

{{ Life through a box , soyboys and
//finds the boundaries of their rectangles all the time
//you're a a homo sapian god sakes
//we got a lot farther on this hike
//
}}

Boundaries
never tell you how to live a good life

me triangles are my favorite shape,
but no i'm no triangle with my thinking.
unless we're playing soccer
with all time goalies
and gay I s

unless we're playing soccer
shout TRIANGULATE
all the time
every time someone is boxing in for a shot
you shout TRIANGULATE!

ME B NO
ME B NO
ME B NO
ME B NO
ME B NO
ME B
ME B NO
ME B
ME B NO
ME B
ME B NO

no one knows

what how to live means easy

not perfect but follow me

long as you want

blunt or not blunt

shot or no shot

you got plenty of shots

in and out of here

we're not stupid

no one has just one shot

that mind set a shackle on your mind    


no I prefer to know people by the meals they provide
and they don’t always know mine.
I prefer to cook all the time

my custom though customs...

customs to die

fed by media lies
customs to die

can't remember origin of why
customs to die

new ones installed

dumber ones installed

call it what ya want

call it more than


no

I ain't no squeaky wheel

but

After the first year I wanted to leave school, because all the squeaky wheels
were the only ones getting anything out of the program.

So I thought I’ll just be a squeaky wheel.

It’s not fair its a capitalist situation. Graduate film program

Coming in live, it's me, the Grant Queen

most the top causes of death

are modern man made

was land of the free

now land of the toxic made

rubbing our pits with aluminum

plastic in our forks

5g in our heads

cannabis in our dreads

from land of the free

to land of the cancer farm

chips in our food

misinformation happens

every time government sneezes

for good reason people stupid

but its a negative feedback loop

don't trust the populace with the realities of life

and they fall apart society falls apart

ok well

what kind of society do you want to live in

how do we improve without throwing a reset on society?

by tesla's standards

society doesn't reset

if society was death

by nikola's mind

when we die

we go back to light

our square one

that's while

I been here since day 0

V Dub guitar hero

so

most the top causes of death

are preventable

duckduck go

modern man made

I get laid

eat pussy daily

find the meaning in the scene


___


I got some unpopular beliefs

when you say most people
I zone in n out
zoom in n out
that's lazy language
group identifications
I spek macro individual
as a left handed lefty
internet's a human right
make society better right

make world easier to live in
kill yourself if that's not happening
on you
that's why you're alive
check out that show tonight     


___


soyboys gettign nasty

4chan making new meaning outa nasty daily

estrogen in the water got me heady

women depressed
cause men driving the train
men depressed cause they dicks ain't the same

broken down and up

after getting heart broken

so they hide in their penis

chasing bitches

make me sick eat

good men eat pussy daily man

from men to soy boys

GIRUGAMESH !!!!


towers not the phones

stay alive grow your own food go home

call everyone and ask how to help

if every did that every night

comuntiy without sarcasm

behind closed scenes rape babies to death

pray to fucked up greeeeeeen men

THere I said it man

without misinformation fools (schills)

lookup the press and the president    

look up political speeches in the

twenty years ago

run it through a word analyzer

find that modern presidents speak at the high school level

20 years ago they all spoke at the college level

everyone's getting more worried more pig like more stupid

more paranoid less forgiving more ruthless

all my life could fit in a box


she's like I want to live in your world
I'm like you won't survive my world
my worl crush your chest
my world can't pay rent
my world live off women
my world uplift women
my world clean and eat
my world work and clean
my world ciggie quitting
dirty addict past unforgiven
by god
cept everyone can't catch up with god
stuck up in their box
with they mind on locks
I use no glock
nearly killed myself

walked up
rails of bridges
too high for me
just to feel this free
live what you preach with who you love
live to learn teach when asked cuz


as a kid
showered with goggles
and a bathing suit

now I'm climbing 60 foot trees

as a kid
I slept with all lights on all night
now I'm diving mine shafts petting sleeping bats
'bandoned mercury mine shafts
bever giving out
jig of rossi on way to the caves
fresh aircooled engine
in 71 bus
thank God Todd baskin
taught me to install it
swapped engines just to hit it big in the cruz
better I got at life worse I got at school
no more 80 bucks an hour
to listen to some fool
two thirds underpaid brain under fig newton tree
no one mentioned tesla nough now the car
stole his shadow
they took a great genius
hid his work
now you only know him as an electric car   
how the fuck you going to learn that in school
aiming for the stars   
materialism taught
in every nested meaning
see through this
do something good for yourself
drop out
watch free lectures and practicing thinking

learn how to memorize well

practice memorizing

eat shit good for your brain

always have something you're reading

not cereal boxes

get addicted to that brain strain

like a noodle in your face if your face was a skull

{{ this big nooddle on patrol }}

know

as a kid

know
