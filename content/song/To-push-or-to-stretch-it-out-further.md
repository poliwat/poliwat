should I push what I know or stretch it out farther

like stay up all night by the lake

just to see the light a minute

worth the 12 hours

she doesn't know

I don't know how to explain it

but it's worth it


every time

and

every fucking time

whter it's overwhleming

or something beyond me

yeah it's a bad tip beyond repairing

but also something tht no one ever knew

just me being judged, dot dot dot

typing, typing, typing,
its okay its last call and I barely sipped my last

shouldn't of ordered it so it'll be a good walk home

where I don't wanna go

I wanna go meet some actual
humans
for once
instead

```
first time drinking at whole foods bar

of course I'm last at the bar

only sounds now is the registers closing
and I'm half finished on my drink

typing vehmently

doesn't matters
laptops gonna die but I won't

thought sometimes I wish

I could trade places with my dad
so he didn't have to feel that

```
