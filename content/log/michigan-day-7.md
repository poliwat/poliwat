I wish I could share my favorite tape. I wish I could even state what's on the tape as well. But what's life without secrets?
I'll take the [USGOV](https://www.usa.gov/) approach. In 20 years it won't matter so it will be the *declassified* tapes.

In the meantime I will share a gem I don't want to forget - Tommy Betts the man who mentored my dad in music, and my father.
I'm playing some piano in the background, and the recorder I left on their table. You can hear the pride in my dad's voice, and it will stay with me forever.
