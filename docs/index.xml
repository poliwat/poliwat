      <description>The Federal Beat Reserve is the following:
 The Federal Beat Reserve is a dictionary with electronic instrumentals as the definitions. It’s name plays upon the idea that the US government might officially support the creative cataloging of music for the people. My aim is to create a non verbal sound reference for every word in language, through the action of encapsulating everything semantic into a discrete duration of instrumental music.</description>

      <description>miss myself missing you - poliw.at [early release] 13:03
Freewrite #123089 &amp;lsquo;What a piece of work is man? Washing up dishes this morning plotting how to cut my dick off, I get too horny too often for this lifestyle. But it teaches patience, my current best reason to look forward to aging. Some men say it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Well yeah that&amp;rsquo;s probably right, but you have more time to develop your interests.</description>

doesn&amp;rsquo;t meant anything
is nothing

      <description> capo 4 (waking up G and more, listen to it)
 (verse 1) I was wandering in my head even though I&#39;m tired tired you came wandering like a Pokemon you would always lie high in the grass just like a lazy Snorlax z z z you could be a Butterfree (verse 2) you came a running cause there was a spider all up in your face face I latched on quick like a Bulbasaur now we are face to face (reprise) ho ho ho ho kisses are wet ho ho ho ho kisses fucking sting (bridge) the moment you get outa that existential funk the moment you stop seeing that punk (build up fast part) (( all a big &amp;gt; )) we can and we can talk and have a platonic relationship in the back of my bus cause everything is cool and everything is great when we live in a world where no one master bates and if you go to church and compartmentalize your life and do what your told and your told to be a wife the rich are getting richer and the poor always want more so lets just pop some molly and hit the dance floor (verse 3) fee fie foe fum here comes my girlfriend and I think she&#39;s mad at me there&#39;s diminishing returns on apologies so I say sorry strategically but ho ho ho ho kisses are wet ho ho ho ho kisses fucking sting  </description>

Had a great day of work for Aris
when I did the transfer from the blue line to the brown I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like quite going home yet. I walked around looking for a nice sounding ambient place to record brown dog. It was only 8 pm and only chains and nice restaurants were open. Nothing I liked. I somehow walked straight to the next CTA station, and yet again gave someone a smile and they asked for money, anyone you smile at in the city is looking for money so far.</description>

      <description>you are a wonderful person too complex a creature to be nailed down on any one person place or thing besides maybe you&#39;ve got the same curse as me patiently waiting for the freedom working towards the freedom of diner hopping going from diner to diner to diner to diner.  Cause when you get to one, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter it it&amp;rsquo;s a desert outside, a busy street, or snowing. Diners stay timeless.</description>

Each track is a git command line, the idea being an instrumental track you can hit play on whenever you need that command.

when you hear so much of people dying
related it to the plasted and wax paper
related to the convenience of hot n ready food
and the weirdos thinking
if it all gives you cancer don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it
i cant cure your white lady
but i cn love you in a new way
everytime
and the plastic

BS was going down at 530 and my mom and sister went and I was silently not invited back and later my mom said it was good I didn&amp;rsquo;t go and that she thinks the devil got me and she laughed and I just want to kill myself cause although I told my sister last week satan&amp;rsquo;s most brilliant invention was the &amp;lsquo;word of God&amp;rsquo; - I still get spiritual guidance through bible study and the community is nice.</description>

      <description>POLIW.AT Music Videos Music is not a purely auditory experience, it is also a visual medium. When we hear audio, our brains want to fill in the visual gaps. My poliw.at music videos are a pursuit of reflecting this exchange where I use visual instruments and a suite of video tools to create the videos in real time.
