last night we had matt jack marina ted brian denis helen cam all in the same spot and had a great fucking time ||

I was trying to finish the PBD site, the sequence starts in 2 days \\ \\ but stopped by 10 and helped jack with an 8 minute max version of the sims sims for some play competition at piano fight - the winner gets 5 grand.

last year's play that won was no country for old henchmen so the bar is low
