First time drinking in a whole foods.

<!--more-->

**2109**

Never drank in a whole foods

so its fitting
first time you get drunk
then tpy 200 words  
a minute it feels
plans out the window

80 words a minute it is

but feels
200 plus 3 tips

and an open card means
I'm leaving happy

and my money isn't anything  

doesn't meant anything

is nothing

in the land of the rich

and the free

until dont' have any

that's when it counts

other than that its a meal

and a steal

cause 4 drinks here

or whatever it was

was worth more than the

whole staff of the store

that I can feel


and they clean up all around me

way before closing

cause they're well seasoned

to rich spoiled parents

that somehow find a way to complain

from the top

that's tip of the spear

why I tip bad here

whats a buck extra a drink

more than a tithe for me

though I'd never tell them

less they got lights isn their eyes

and thunder thighs

none of that here

just chicken bones in trainers

celibate mindset

though I had sex today   

it's not my fault

what I tell god

I plead

it's not my fault

no one can keep

up with me

you made me this way

tools too many

so mediation only way

to stay

Just cruzin the neighborhood
Just boozin in the neighborhood
Just loosing the neighbors,
now look good, now look good
(post about it)

She doesn't go outside
No mirrors outside
This hottie isn't outside
Then she ends up in a pile
Now look cute, now look cute


daddy says shutup
make no mistakes
and get straight A's
that's how you were rasied
but we combed the streets
and we combed the lakes
and we combed our hair looking for you
your parents are worried you didn't come home
your parents are worried you didn't come home
make no mistakes
make no mistakes

Just cruzin the neighborhood
Just boozin in the neighborhood
Just loosing the neighbors,
now look good, now look good
(post about it)
yeah look good
