****2351****

h is the best thingin this town

and she's not in this town

like Iâ€™m underwater and my proprioception is telling me my skin is a few centimeters off of where it actually is so its lying
and Im doing these things and apathy is the main underlying feeling

fire as a field bridge
water as a field bridge
air as a field bridge
humans as a field bridge


**1220 next day**

I'm still sober and I beyond depressed

no one is available intellectually

idk I'm apathetic about my eventual suicide at this point
