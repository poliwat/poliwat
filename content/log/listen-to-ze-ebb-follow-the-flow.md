**Tuesday 1136 AM**

Haven't made a single post, but I work all the time. Some who don't work much post all the time, what am I doing? Why am I not comfortable sharing shit on the interent?

I don't understand my relationship to the web sometimes. I have two comission pieces, less than 100 dollars, I think it's cause I can't record into Ableton right now ||

But today is all about posting || finishing Death Ep with Ted ++ || setting up triggers and finishing the studio and getting a loan || if those three ||

|| oh and I'll finally take photos of everything AND EMPTY AND UPGRADE STORAGE ON PHONE YES ||
