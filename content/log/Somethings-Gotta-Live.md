Another work day!!! I need to build a shelf for these monitors :D

just going to jump into making music vizzies, sent my resume stuff out to pandy a second time. I told her I'd give her 100 bucks if she gets me the job, and she just laughed at me lol.

Last but not least is the monitors need to go up, I have to go on the lookout for wood in the street to make a quick shelf to hold the right one. Then the webcam needs a home, on a stand. I need that for VDMX stuff next. I think I'm going to ask my mom to send me the PBD controller, but in the meantime I will make vizzies without them. The goal will be making 24 hours of programmed content that's 100% mine.

Going to start with the music videos it looks like, yesterday I set up my router that came in the mail so I can transfer files between the windows and mac quickly. Pretty mad the RAM I ordered doesn't work.....

I feel weird, it's time to hole up in Ableton for sure. Let's see if I can get 10 albums out before the end of the month.
