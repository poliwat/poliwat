#### Lyrics

```
cafe o lay


its not fair

your anger wont do you good here
in the swamp
its the mire
where they used to send all the homosexuals

we're in our swamp boots
you pointed out
these aren't my boots
I looked down


lets breath out our anger now
jump in teaching machine

this treaching smoke-stack



she just got addy
never mind my past with that
I want her to call me daddy
am I big nough for that

let me get you drunk enough
to fuck my old cunt
freemont
fuck I cant unsee that

my heart is broken
but I know
I was a token
in your machine
that got ejected
you know what I mean

if you still love me
like you say you do
then why cant we be

why does it feels like 
stolen history
hometown now



tryna gather the goons
be well dont waste this i made some calls its been given back to you no one knows a potheads rage like I know your face left my new clothes on air train air head air head shes gone air head shes gone I know break ups are rough diahrea tough pulled a columbo just one more thing I hope you are my next chungking express and all the things why even make money with art why make money at all
if money is the root of your depression why make money at all im on island time playing hop scotch with city rats how romantic we were the theatre that night we becamse broadway playing hop scotch with city rats our disappearing act burnt my hands tying to entertain just to prove I can make it 60
minutes without mentioning my friends that don't exist that don't exist to you stop tryna fight if you dont believe this pains bigger than pile of dead babies use it as fuel to not hate dont be a disgrace whiles shes alive weird sea my number is not a window to my soul my number is not a window to my goals i leave my place with no tracking device everyone looks lame on their devices
I love the city but where can you play russian roullette
dont overthink friend is top tier satanic advice friend
I love the city
I loce the citty
each lie builds on my back
I loe the city AI love the city
each lie add to the rack
had to learn tot lie to thrice
but I swore off stealing
tried to swear off cheating
I oh its a wonder how im still alive
bang bang
bang bang bang bang
and bang my heart oh my hear loves this city
I love willie bong wonka
I don't care if its not living my best life
I love yoy
i used to u sed to live barefoot on a mountai happy
bt I would give it all up i olove you
live in the sewers i love you
i remember dying when you moved (out)
still saying i love you
vietnam we don't come back from that
world war 3 dont come back from that

we dont comae back from that from that no one comes back from that what causes what effect frequencies have on us
our the power hearing we hear outside my hearing
i hear whats worse
you cutting it off
or slicing me in
theres still joy deal down this well---
