Long train ride.
Very excited about the next couple of days. It looks like TSS, stanford radio station, then noisebridge for Thursday and Friday. I'm looking forward to it.

Tomorrow morning I'll wake at 5AM to get started right away on the site for the innovators.

Had a nice time getting Marion's site going together. She gave me 200 bucks for the two hours there and then also 4 hours being a farm hand the other day. I've been failing at getting tape

But Chad and I had some A+ jams last night and they were criminally fun :)
