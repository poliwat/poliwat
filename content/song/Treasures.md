#### Lyrics

```

I really wanted
ever so much to recognize
all the treasures
of my life
a second subjunctive
literature can't describe
hidden in books which speak through lies

a second subjunctive
picking at crystal skies
waving in oceans
trying not to die
I really wanted
ever so much to recognize
the treasures
in front of my eyes
```
