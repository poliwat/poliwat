*Tuesday 919 AM*

Today I can already feel. It's going to be a good day. I'll mindlessly and endlessly produce. Today marks the day I need to empty this childhood bedroom of all my shit, which I'm going to move up to San Mateo.


Listening to 2000 hits

Dad's extra nice because my mom's stressed out, it's make it or break her heart if I don't do a good job. Good thing I'll rock it because this is EASY MOMM!!!!!

Ahahahah Dan Harmon talking about how blogging came to be therapy. Yeah this is my therapy, but I'm not blogging in my mind. HOLY FUCK I LOOKED IT UP AND I'M BLOGGING. God damn I'm fucking retarded

More bounces, less cannabis and writing. 1 million confucious canoes. Get me to an island, then I'll be perfect.

I should delete all this

I'm building the muscles I'm going to need when I'm fat.

I'm practicing how to create stuff everyday, these hours are going to pay off when I'm older.

Operation moveout complete, even had time to walk the dog with Chad, learn some new guitar chords, and 1000 confucious canoes ðŸ›¶


Chad's making protein coffee drinks and I'm going to finish my new port site, and apply to two jobs. Bonnie invited me to wonderwoman but I can't I gotta work.

*11 PM*

I wasn't sure what to write on the about page for my new portfolio site, so I want to make a little simple rap explaining my life and what I'm all about.
First draft of the lryics here:


      [Chorus] x1  
      The world my stage though I feel more a prop (10)
      The clue I learned from view in rearview mob (10)
      my tongue blunt tool my TONGUE she like on pop (10)
      The world my stage though I feel more a prop (10)

      [Verse 1]
      I think of life like a book that's my hook (10)
      I'm writing it (4)
      I the main character, I act like it
      Caesar said the world your stage and (7)
      Itâ€™s up to you what role you want to play (10)

      highlights high life my life
      it romantic God bless it
      razor sharp focus every rose I notice (11)
      my religion more women in power (10)
      my conviction more color in power (10)
      my mantra more women in power (10)
      my conviction more color in power (10)

      cause even pubs know who get the job done

      [Chorus 1]
      The world my stage though I feel more a prop
      The Clue I learned from view in rearview mob
      my tongue blunt tool my TONGUE she like on pop
      The world my stage though I feel more a prop     

      [Verse 2]
      lower the greed the feeds with ad ruthless (11)
      my life I comedy class Addict
      hate it though I'm a sucka lova of language
      my tongue a blunt tool
      my tongue that she like
      my life I ride it white
      rapids class 4 24/7
      I'm a sucka for hyrule herb, red alert, a quick jab,
      a bad meme, a cute cat
      a girl that makes art with her hands yeah
      like my mom who writes 20 post it notes a day
      alcoholic but I saw the pattern then I trained
      my mental
      screaming I'd walk the plank for my dreams
      type fuck
      bare feet on the coffee table
      high life like roller coaster
      no coasters for dad's coronas (7)
      the lows worth the highs (5)
      highs come in 50 flavors (7)
      I fifty shades of pride (6)
      fifty shades of mike (5)
      I fifty shades of die (6)
      couldn't curb my taste for a glock 9 (9)
      to save my life (4)
      toss a pun in the chamber, aye ()

      I evolve I lead my life like a play
      romantic red lip red wine dark comedy
      oh god when will I outgrow
      this taste for lead in my skull

      [Chorus 2]
      I love our troops cause I feel their love
      I feel their strength I make the best of
      I reject the words good job
      I love our troops cause I feel their love


      I look around
      pay tribute to the ones behind and gone
      cause my heritage permits it
      nature rewards courage
      ignorance destroy it that's my monkey military mindset
      a dirty hippy with a love for aviation
      and all things considered,
      military mike the world is upside down so I hang on my head
      empathy goes far mate
      the world is upside down so I hang on my head
      get 2 minutes that my daily habit
      [verse 3]
      speaking of habits
      the bad comes with the good
      I tell myself kill myself
      I almost did it on my 21st, dramatic
      balancing act on railing with no remorse
      I survived
      a lot of love to give I work through fear,
      lust or love
      fear or trust
      I'm scatter brained but a good shot
      shotgun approach on lock

      I gotta lotta unpopular beliefs
      I look thin I look around
      most are lost they look down
      depressed fed with fresh amazon prime


      [Hook 1]
      I wanna hashtag everything with climatechange |stop
      I wanna hashtag everything with climatechange |drop

      honestly honesty best policy

      most are lonely


  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--DONE



      I'm a sucka for a good river
      A simple man with a simple plan
      to make it in this world
      to old age, evolve from
      hopeless romantic to dying cynic
      cause it ain't gonna happen in this lifetime


      so we gotta work addicted
      so we gotta work addicted
      I evolve I lead my life like a play
      romantic red lip red wine dark comedy

      cause the good comes with the bad      

      [Hook 2]
      pay up to express yourself around here ey?

      [Chorus 2]
      The world my stage though I feel more a prop

      I have some unpopular beliefs
      we in a simulation (7)
      I have some unpopular beliefs
      everyone act like children (7)
      I prefer the simple and the poor
      versus the fake and the rich
      I rich I gotta lotta love to give
      but couldn't keep the lights on
      to save my life sold my switch
      used to be
      airsoft in the fields
      adventuring for endless days summer days
      lord's supper that mom's lasagna
      peanut butter what I prefer now though
      weathered webmaster I remember us kids

      pooling 5 bucks a pop to get at a router
      I used to hate high school
      cause I was more the Zappa type
      no one seemed to celebrate the weird back in high
      my vibe Clapton Hendrix John Grisham
      Lucid Dreaming self hypnosis Loaded tan tien

      [verse 3]
      speaking of habits
      the bad comes with the good
      I tell myself kill myself
      I almost did it on my 21st, dramatic
      balancing act on railing with no remorse
      I survived
      a lot of love to give I work through fear,
      lust or love
      fear or trust
      I'm scatter brained but a good shot
      shotgun approach on lock


      I'm trying
      help
      speaking of which that's what life is
      so, bruce lee told me be like water like
      I'm the rapids I'm obsessed
      20,000 leagues I imagine
      dive into my subconsciousness come up with more compassion
      that my cannon


      //favorite class ever was music theory with englemann







      KD spread better than any 9th grader
      but I forgot
      the numbers gave it up for trust

      honestly expressing myself at all costs  
      I'm Michael Betts




      overshare my philosophy
      so you could get a piece of
      the action of love in two bars
      instead of drowning in that
      new drank Syrian rubble at the bar
      no such thing as a free lunch yeha
      honestly honesty best policy
      that's why family little scared of me
      speaking of it, speaking of me
      currently my currency is running thin
      fiscally I flatline but have a softer side
      for passing my last bread to the homeless


      they my main therapists
      cause they know better
      than anyone the world is messed up
      but don't have the tools to rise
      instead to sabotage their luck
      its all mental though
      employees choose the job not the employer
      the ancient master slave is
      modern day debtor owner
      association









      anger in my heart



    [verse 2]
      music oh god please show me the way
      via a vogue vignette my last ovature
      lords ways
      verbatim my motif ostinato rigore
      why sperm bank deny me
      wouldn't tell me
      lie to me

      Betts hath done run wild since the revolution
      I the child the youngest by recent reunion
      I have to have kids to maintain the family name
      but is it worth it when the list of adjectives long
      'wild'
      'suicidal' 'alcoholic' or 'cray'
      just another task on told TO DO list apps
      it high learning curve to be
      I child of god
      I child of the web
      I child of love
      my parents love me but don't understand
      why TV sucks you are what you eat
      I like to make music off bea

      **I have a general idea
      about what I want to do with my life**
      I have
      I prefer
      I trust
      I reject
      I have
      friends in many places and spots of life
      but k-12 was another side of the line
      last picked or straight ignored
      learned the hard way any attention
      is better than being ignored




      I prefer
      my career making art
      I borrow from everything
      cause I live in the future
      but the present is mean
      all my good friends know not to lend out
      cause what I borrow I forget about
      too much information
      I borrow from the air force
      by way of executing my ideas
      I'm a force to be reckoned with
      and I'm a keep executing my ideas
      chasing my dreams

      I'm going to leave this world
      at least trying
      hard enough
      but it's never good enough
      even if it takes me to under a bridge
      I carry  
      an empty stomach to focus
      I reject
      the words good job
      This millennial that works harder
      than your best office workhorse
      destined to be an employer
      that could only be true if
      I was the real Michael Betts
      This verse need revisions
      its unfinished
      like all projects
      I pursue in life
      help me finish something
      and I'll share all
      I've learned


*103 AM*

But well I wrote all this instead of finishing up the portfolio site like a good human would've done. It was fun writing though, and needs revisions. But fun to loosely rap too.
