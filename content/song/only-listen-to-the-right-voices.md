But how can you tell their 'right'?

<!--more-->

### step 1

When they 'speak', ask to what degree of the truth are they communicating.

And know what right is so well that when your body and mind and soul are wrong you still know what's right.

### step 2

Don't tell people you hear them, until you're true homies.

### step 3

Your bombshell dance partner, is all the right voices at the right time. That's the difference between Jesus and that homeless guy everyone knows that thinks they're jesus.
