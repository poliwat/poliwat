#### Lyrics

```

1-2-3
look at me
someones pissed at me
again
cmon
jump on the train or don’t
but don’t forget 
respond don’t react 
and count
1 - 2 - 3 
when your talking to me 
but can’t listen
when you can watch tv 
but you can’t see


am I hear judging you what you consume?
when you act crazy yes 
im sorry 


nigga
you whack
get the retard calm
I so I count 
1 - 2 - 3 
when I’m responding to you
you sound agitated and that negative emotions infectious




——
every thing i rap 
i just add cause aliens
ets 
eta 
what you do to me
rise up 
rise above	
splitter patter the matter of mastered thought 
of a dance doing actions above words
color or creed
juiced or clean! 

blow out dem ears
partly sunny you tired boy
partly cloudy you mild Roy

aight lunch break
brb 
slack emojis
talking with people in the park
strangers in the park
strangers on the rock
I attract the Nautilist crew
20k leagues than any deeper jew
unless they knew
geometric concepts in the very letters of the talmud 
then ok yeah then they 20k deep 
and thats just baseline
Go Jews! 
Go jews!
I love all races and creeds
I got half roosky in me 
vodka is water
spliffs are food
what you gonna do?

[BALLAD]
justified my weaknesses
turned them into strengths 
neutered my ambitions
to kindle the flame
now we got an oven
a pond apart
but the ocean is nothing but a glass jar 
your eyes are darker than pale
your my pale blue void 
and I’m annoyed 
I don’t own that damn diner in new mexico
pick you up at the airport 
we embrace	
(let’s go) *whisper   

so anyways we
caught an abode adobe on the desert floor 
ran to river was never the choir
daily occurances magic
in pride and prejudice spastic 
cause I bring my own gentlemen 
to the table 
we eat greek 
at the piano
now she’s taking off on ukelue
and Im pounding the drums
but its an exercise ball
cause Im dumb as fuck

oh but where can I buy 
a mid century modern exercise ball?
I got dam balls tried her nerves
fried my brain to reupload my own OS 
poliw.at is more than an artist name
only snippets until the flood
no warning 
when we all knew the cause
but now warnings are blasted
over hundreds of years
{and clinton 20 years ago 
used the slogan 
make america great again
and twenty years later
rinse and repeat

cause if you’re any smart as a billionaire 
you make money off both sides
we flip coins
they make money heads 
they make money tails
I give girls good head
but I’m waiting like a monk 
a psycho a punk 
a worker a suit a drunk 
a city dweller on the edge 
in the bathroom 
withth that single lamp
on the recording podium thats now for sale 
UP UP 
THANK YOU GOD 
for the opportunity
for building a lab in a basement in a matter of months
now its sick as fuck
but I follow God 
and trust in my dreams
and he’s telling me
time to pack it up
sell it all 
grab dad’s van out the shop
build a bed for a yoga pad
storage on bottom for the guitar and projector
and a battery amp 
for professional busking
and work a farm and what nots 
recording the whole way 
the entire chelada
and daily updates to the sites 
both of them get it right
and master your yin your yang
and do it every day 
and I know you’re a natural 
vlog mic 
but don’t end up like robin williams
even though your middle names william
even though the voices lie  
go to the place where you observe the thought
and trim it down
a mastered cosmic pilot masters Earth 
in this way 
every time
knowing it all comes down to the tree 

welcome to mics welcome to the 

and then it started we had to leave the system 
```
