I had an option between food || vape
and I chose vape for the night!

did 3 workout classes

about to run through TSS.

we're playing



what about the founding duahgters!
the type that ass that make me holla
sideways Id walk the plank to get lost in her ways
then get sidetracked mic check is this thing on
I'm tired of drugs
I gotta move on
I say that off cannabis
my medication


copped a mirage in la

by the seed of my pants like my mentor

@ jack's in San Mateo

no comment but the best YT comment from this Steven Pinker videO:

```

Herds do it.  Geese do it.
Even segregated creeds do it.
Let's do it.  
Let's fly in formation.ï»¿

```


Yeah I just want to write something by only using YT comments. A whole novel using only YT Comments?
Or a religious doctrine.
