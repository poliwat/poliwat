He's sober! We're almost at the 30 day mark - the final night really. Tomorrow is Ina's Bday- what better way to celebrate than to crack the seal?

4 loads of laundry, on the second.
Irrelevent, was naked most of the morning making practice tracks on the new and imporoved music cart. The lord prevails.
