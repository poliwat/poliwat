@ the Abbey.

I've been not quite functional lately. I must admit. I see Justine my future singing teacher here though and I'll talk with her when she looks a little less busy.

I don't get it.

Did I perma fry ?

Did I really fly too close to the sun ?

Once again I feel like going home. I don't know how to pay rent yet again, due proper in a week (but maybe I could stall as it trickles in)

laser cutter still doens't work. poliw.at doesn't freaking work.

and I wonder if I want to do pale blue in the first place even right now.

I think that's the chemicals. Maybe I'd like to take a break from it.
