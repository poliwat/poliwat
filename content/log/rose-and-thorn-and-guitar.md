```
thats a truth and a half
or half truth

I tasted your white lies
through red lips
off red wine

Listen to desert dwellers
Isis oasis

A little north of Santa Rosa

Good fire spinning shut in Saturday and Sunday

Popped a tab at a taqeuria

Okay 👌🏾 so
Buy local Max
Buy local min

Rose and thorn and guitar 🎸

Hop monk

And also flappers and kids

And also at a bar trying to score bud

And also being sick and feeling like the victim of a gangbang on my throat

Hashtag too many pics

Mom get out of my womb

What do you do?
I whittle
I carve gang signs into skin artfully

```
