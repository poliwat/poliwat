> lyrics:

```
C            Am
I want a ball to toss around
C            Am7
like when I was small
C            Am
like when I was small
C            Am7
knock knock knock
C            Am
I live next door and every moment
C            Am7
I see I see uniqueness
F         G       F            G7
and I see suffering under your eyelids
C            Am
I want a ball just to toss around
C            Am7
I want a ball just to toss around

so lets play tags with the neighbor kids
I'll hide in the trash then pop out real quick
we're gonna die soon so don't be a bitch
that's what life is I don't have perfect pitch

```

```

we did a cheers with helen and I on modelos
my dad with buttermilk and he said  
rage against the darkness of the night
and we clinked glasses


```


she sells me down the river
bout hitting my dads oxygen
so I don't speak to her


lourdes I met on the train

sent a heating blanket

and wrote a wonderful letter


he said it was beyond fantastic

today I was told by chris to read page 127 of the hospice handbook

im sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place she used to say

often

drafts and drafty drafts

I wish there was a draft but we're in nipomo and it's the best weather in the states. Operah said so I don't believe her, I've lived it. ()
