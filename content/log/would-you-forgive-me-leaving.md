```

or will I end up like mom
who filmed bunnies too much


blocked it all out just to find myself


12 days left of the ableton trial lets make it count.

cause I've had a lot of coffee n
and I'm about to crash into the rocks

( aka means I'm high )

this bitch doesn't spell my name right
this bitch can't even spell my name
I don't correct her

**Thursday 647 PM**

I chose the pen x12
I chose the sword


its colaboreighteen you gotta have both
coding is the new reading and writing
gotta learn it
or die in an ai zoo
modelled after our zoo?
I saw a depressed lion
by himself in santa barbara

I chose to swoon
I chose to swoop
I chose to swoon
I choose to swoop
I choose to swoon
I chose to swoop
I chose to swoon  
```


my studios a field
