**Friday 723 PM**

In the car with chad, we heading back from Sean and Ashley's

my mom gave me 40 bucks for some shoes and socks (I'm borrowing some of chads old skate shoes)

but we never made it, so I'm going to give her the money back and ask if she could instead

get poliw.at back online for the year, because as of this moment, it fell down.

I'm completely out of money and have gone so far as to not know what I'd do with it personally,

except to give to the people I trust, then I trust they'll take care of me. That's how the whole ship should run. I just imagine living in a bunch of interactive sandboxes, and money fucks with that illusion. A good micro day I don't wanna be alive is playing on the radio.
