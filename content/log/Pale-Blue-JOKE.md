Getting a lot of trouble focusing, getting lost in kirsten hacker's blog inbetween ableton exports... and pulled out the materials I requested from SVA. Looks great, what can I say.

Just to re hash, it's the month of October, which is the month of production - the main goal of the month is to continue filling up the folders of each acronym. Then November is going to be the curating month. December will be the distribution month.
