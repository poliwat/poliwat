**Sunday 213 PM**

If you want to know how it's going,

it's going smokey

we are wearing masks outside on account of the Thomas fire.

Today is Sunday,

I got a 2015 Mitsubishi mirage that is in near perfect condition for 4500 last night in Oleta. Kevin Craig and I drove down together for it. It is 'plasma purple' though it really is mother fucking pink AHAHAHAHAHA! I love it.

So there's a play rehearsal today, so I'm going to go over the script a bunch with Chad. Also tomorrow we are printing business cards.

Blah blah blah something's giong down at the Men's club now. Been writing some new piano tunes. brb in a car.
