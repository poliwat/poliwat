# (He's a Billionaire but this sounds better)

**Thursday 114 AM**

I'm real disapointed in myself.

Threw up at the first coozi sesssion @ my new place up empire grade. The place gets a new
name _pbdHQ == Pale blue dawt studios._

Hey steve

I'm michael michael betts

I'm sorry I missed yoU!

I'm the webmaster for the innovators show, usually I'm there on Fridays.

I know you're the dude for trends but a little bit about myself.


Let's be frank. Life is short.

And there's not much we can do much about it.

A couple months ago I went to Marquette michigan with my dad for a family reunion. He hadn't been in his hometown in 37 years.

I had a religious experience

I did a bunch of acid

blah blah blah

it was life changing.


Hey! You're the man to talk to, because I'm working on some projects.

I'm working on some projects.

I am obsessed with the action of providing value to others, and that's what I dedicate my life to. I dedicate my life to producing.

Life is short,

Best case scenario you become a master,

I developed this system of being able to meet and record new people, and turn the everyday into a musical.

Here's the press kit for _paleBlueDawt_

So Steve, I got accepted by the social good to make PBD a nonprofit. Which I'm down to do, and if you fund it then you get a chance to get your name on it.

It would be fun to work with you!

Stay Lean.

Give me a budget, and I'll give you cutting edge digital media.



Movie for a millionaire / is better name than movie for a Billionaire

I have over a terabyte of audio I've personally recorded. I've recorded birthdays, funerals, secrets. I call it Guerilla audio.

So for the chump change price of 2,000 a month, I'll send you a video noting my progress, on the pale blue dawt platform.

If you'd like to advise or know anyone that can help, that's welcome!

I'm real open to advice.

I am michael betts
and I am an industrious hippy

I am spending 10k hours on mastering producing.

what you get is a video, with the aim to be better each time, each month. We may advise each other. You get all my resources. I have so much talent in my life, it's magic.

I breed new ideas. You need me and I need you. I can't make rent. If you don't want to fund me, I would kill for a work hookup.

after this many years, I finally know what metacupcake is.

it's the act of meta recording, like if I record a full readio show, then then next week, I record live over the recording of the radio show, and continue that indefinitely. Then you're working directly with your previous work. Hearing what you did a week ago should always leave room for improvement. So then l  


I'm well on the road to master the art of producing.
