#### Lyrics

```

horse clcks chia chia improv western vibes

if theres a time and a place for anything
then theres one for lying
and as we stand on this bridge
and your crying
lets not just pretend

so Ive given you a chance
to come up come clean
cause im tired of bathing
but when its you I want
adn whe you cheat and lie to me
im not the one thats gonna come crying

cause im down on my knees and im beggin please please
come help me
do the dishes
and im beggin dauhter please
forgvive me
for only meeitn gyou when you turned 18
and forgive me
out of all the disgusting dreams
that ive spread to you and lied about you
and honestly
im trying to get away
from all the thigns
that make me
cray - zeee

and tea tia tia di dia
[wester trot[]


V2
so darling
nows your time to come clean
im not so sure you knew what you mean
that you tell me
that that number on your napkin
is just a co worker


and darling im so sorry to say
ive eaten up all your dreams
but mine they stay
cause i believe in things
bigger than you and I
and I try to catch up both of our dreams and get them alligned 
come over janitor
