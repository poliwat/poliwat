##### lyrics;

```
I use I use I use
I use books as monopods
they my monopods thats why my tunes got pops
learned to love em ((unconditional))2
why ever since high school
love was loving the weakness
a little Leutenant Dan in me
even if you missing legs  
and my fingers missing girls
and my girls missing fingers
and I know I will say anything
just to feel this
and to steal it away
that's the moment today
notha fucking hotel indoor bathroom window aye aye
thats all you need for some therapy
thats what I learned from motha fuckin symphonies
that are silent
not a single word though
that's the fucking point
that's why I listen though
hm
there's always time to shut the fuck up
when you screaming on the inside its hard to keep it in
oh what up Imma mother fuckin break it down
I never slow down
I never throw out
even without a paddle now
and I'm still kicking rowing
everybodys throwing stones
I don't fucking feel it
OH no drama that's a fucking joke yeah  
turn around I'm sharper than a cutco and you know this
composer time is fucking with the past
and the present and the future in the same fucking context
damn
then I go and change it
every fuckin few moments
that's why I go fast (holy shit)
that's why I need a lot of fucking friends
I gotta lotta love to give
and not a lot ways to and a lot of ways to express it
this is fucking spring street
I will fucking drive them
downtown
when I would feed
needa needa a escape
up in high school today
I talkin  act before
I fucking ditched yesterday

bonnie said psychedelics ruined my life
mom said I used to be so fucking nice
till went to santa cruz
{lindsey called it lindsey called it lindsey called it} >
santa booz
and you know that I went hard

(V2)
but the friends and the skills acquired
easily worth the cost
I'd do it ten times over it
if hell freezes over non apathetic
I take the cost
damn dead
it's priceless every single moment
reprogram your brain then when you fuckin hate this
subject yourself to fuckin challenge
everyday
get addicted to it
I'm not afflicted to it
throw me in the coffin 7 days
I won't lose my fucking mind today
what kind of teacher and preacher
could've fucking preach that?
I don't give a fuck if you think you got some feelings
Your either a tool of the induhry
do you feel this
tool of the industry   
or tool of academics
or you a fuckin artist or shark in the house of cards
or maybe you could just stuck getting caught
like kevin spacey now you making fun of me today

hey doesn't matter cause I make fun of myself
as a habit oh whatch your mental health

(V3)
oh check it out this is just from a fucking car
it a corolla and get it sup super from fucking far
tho I fucked it up on mountain road
Im driving drunk
5 am
then I meet someone from lockheed martin whatup
yea dang
he's gonna drop some bombs on yemen
ah uh yeah dang
no he's not he's going to just go and scope it
48 hours a day
fucking multiple cameras today
{they only hear the planes they only hear the planes} >
they never see em
they just hear em
it's an auditory experience
just like this
do you feel this
holy shit
up in yemen
checkout USdrone data dot org
yeah man (femanon)
I mean I fucking built it
but I don't have the cash to keep up the courage
its down it's not the courage it's just the fucking server

(chorus)
CHP chadMike notha mirage is hella nice
we drivin legal
had it for 8 months it was never legal
damn I don't need a license plate

```
