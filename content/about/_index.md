<!-- In Broad terms, Paleblue.fm works to produce creative tech projects to document and pursue truth and document among civilizations, cultures, and peoples, to promote positive adaptation practices. Given the dramatic developments in technological changes, to increase empathy. The first project is a podcast that sounds kind of like life, the musical. It's a podcast that gives voice to every human across the social hierarchy, and finds the connections between our differences.

- By documenting and producing people that would otherwise not be recorded, we start a dialogue for their situation in an artistic way. Historically, sparking dialogue is a definitive method for increasing the quality of lives of the people whom the dialogue is about.</div>
