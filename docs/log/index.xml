It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a hot minute between logs here. 1 week? 1 year? 1 life? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how long it&amp;rsquo;s been it&amp;rsquo;s happening again, as cycles educate. This time round run run and found nothing but self introspection factoring every poor sap in my presence holding back enough to not let on I&amp;rsquo;m socio, as if it&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing to be socio opinionated. Bring me someone with the attention span as I.</description>

surprised he called it a treasured memory.
Me and Helcat ate at cantor&amp;rsquo;s and god damn I had the pastrami reuben and have been high ever since. Real
I like these swivel chairs more than that art on the walls
oh this will fuck us up
always talking enthusiastically about how something&amp;rsquo;s going to fuck me up, like this black Yerba Mate Tea, this lavender spray, this homemade kombucha.</description>

Didn’t get soaked till the end of the pier&amp;hellip; so dropped helcat off at grover beach train station, walked pismo and got to the end of the pier. I read the letter freewrite I wrote on the plane from chicago when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was going to make it to my dad in time. Well I fucking made it and he made it one more month and I was there all the time and slept in the room and felt beyond horrid on the couch at myself for not giving him mouth to mouth in his last moments when he said he couldn&amp;rsquo;t breath, and I just fucking hate myself for it and the fine line between hating oneself and loving oneself someone tell me cause I walked pismo without a mind just lead by the theatre of my feet, my feet as a submarine after it rained there, me in all black 3 layers of cotton.</description>

      <description>Dear mom and bonnie, I love you, I want to support yo both, but I&#39;m clearly adding stress to both of your lives. I came here to help dad, I was hoping to stay a few weeks, maybe up to xmas to show support and for us to grieve together. It&#39;s too short a time to rent somewhere else in the area, and I need to be in the city to move my career forward.</description>

that was a month where dtme

 death was life and life was death and they were locked together in an eternal mad lmove battle and this was the final word and the meaning of the world and thence came a radiance that could glorify all misery and thence came a shadow that trumpeted all joy and beauty but from out of this darkness joy burned more intimately and more beautifully and love had a deeper glow within this night -from flute dreams by herman hesse (Strange news from a another star)  </description>

at least bonnie had a successful birth today, and I hope they name the child Nika. Then it would be Nika and Mila. And it makes me think fondly of my friend Nika.

dear helen

whose thoughts these are
that write this now
but I love you
and I have lost control
not that control was ever attained
only illusion of it
yet it feels so good

I got super fire audio yesterday.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been spray painting two song writing clipboards and a lamp I found. I started cleaning my dad&amp;rsquo;s workshop space but realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time.
this all happened yesterday.
this is day 4 sber and I feel pretty okay - just a lil mad at stuff.
Like the first two days of sober my mom starting saying some dumb shit to me and I normally can play it cool and let her run, but not on these two mornings.</description>

Chad&amp;rsquo;s mom died peacefully in her sleep sometime inbetween 7 and 11 AM.
I was sanding this wooden island found by a dumpster while on a walk with my mom this morning, when we saw the fire engine in his front yard and checked it out. There was a cop a healthcare lady and fire guys.
I was the first to call chad, he&amp;rsquo;s in oceanside for a religious holiday.</description>

Tuesdat 741 AM
With v few exceptions, I&amp;rsquo;ve been living the past few weeks only talking with the people that come right up to me in person. I would recommend doing this occassionally - yesterday I hit a new calm while sanding and painting some wood I found in the backyard.
I love working with wood, I could do that all day sober as a bird. The lucy makes it better though.</description>

recording is the only thing I could really lie about easily.
I just got up - wanted to get up at 6:30 AM but didn&amp;rsquo;t have an alarm. I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully find one in the shed tonight. I will take a sleep aide as well.
Cause what I&amp;rsquo;m doing is building the new routine. No distractions, just the bare minimum dope routine of all the stuff I love.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that going back home is helping, although I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing up on the sobriety game.
And it is just a game, cause I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be okay at the end of the day (aka if I affirm that consistently then my chances increase.)
Today is all about remembering things I like. I need to like something more than freestyling!
Like Game theory, you can apply freestyling to everything.</description>

finally made it home so I&amp;rsquo;m feeling a lot better already.
Been wanting to just be here, without distractions for a while now.
its already been super annoying not having a phone - I lost about 10 ideas I wanted to write down today cause I was caught dead in the water, a spot without a means to record.
I&amp;rsquo;ll start carrying a journal around again while I navigate the whole no phone thing otra vez.</description>

barely made it on the amtrack train! well not really had like 15 minutes to spare, but it was real stressful getting here. My phone kept glitching out while I was stuck in traffic on the 17, banking the train being later than myself. Now the phone won&amp;rsquo;t boot, so I get to enjoy the next 5 hours completely by myself. I didn&amp;rsquo;t set up for getting picked up yet, so I&amp;rsquo;ll either find a friendly passenger or hit a coffee shop in SLO and reach out to them over wifi.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been not quite functional lately. I must admit. I see Justine my future singing teacher here though and I&amp;rsquo;ll talk with her when she looks a little less busy.
I don&amp;rsquo;t get it.
Did I perma fry ?
Did I really fly too close to the sun ?
Once again I feel like going home. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to pay rent yet again, due proper in a week (but maybe I could stall as it trickles in)</description>

Sitting in the trailer on our property on the mountain. It&amp;rsquo;s dirty, needs new apolstery and has a mushroom growing on the inside above the door. I&amp;rsquo;ve never lived in a trailer before. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to wallow in existential, cause that kills time.
I like the sounds here. There&amp;rsquo;s two crows having a distinct conversation. I need to calm down. I woke up with a lot of pressure in my head.</description>

I played a live set at the third fern gully installment, it was sweet.
I britney spears&amp;rsquo;d it. I made a 30 min music video / ableton mix. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any live looping like I wanted but did had a nice ratio of 40% written and 60% freestyle throughout the set.
The reception was real next level - people really loved that shit. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely on to something I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, and I don&amp;rsquo;t need to.</description>

 I love to buy plants but I kill every single one. I aspire to one day learn how to keep them alive. I have never broken a bone or had stitches. Don’t drink milk so I don’t buy that strengthen bones garbage.

      <description>Kantas Pri Disciplino (aka chants for discpline)
June 13th 2018 on a hot summer day
This is the first of my chant series. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to imporve discipline, and have found great results by chanting in other ways.
So next time I&amp;rsquo;m in the field, and hit the wall but need to continue, then I can use this chant.
Each word of the chant is a human&amp;rsquo;s name that showed an immense amount of perseverance and discipline in their lives.</description>

      <description>friday 302 pM
how could I progress if I can&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; be honest on here?
this is for me
I am now focusing on mastering discipline. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it will take.
I will learn discipline from the tree twisty. I will visit twisty for 30 days and focus on discipline every time I have a session there.
What are my strategies? How will I know if I&amp;rsquo;m disciplined?</description>

      <description>Monday 953 AM
Why do I record?
There&amp;rsquo;s a few reasons.
In a composer&amp;rsquo;s mindset, everything is an instrument. Humans are instruments
and I like getting them to sing, open up
I like the process of lightening people&amp;rsquo;s souls.
From a composer mindset, it&amp;rsquo;s fun to think of instrument

My granny&amp;rsquo;s hometown. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go there.
I walked home in about an hour and 30 from campus, listening to tape from yesterday and reading 12 rules for life.
The only reason I have jordan peterson&amp;rsquo;s book is because Bean happened to have it and she brought it over. Cas Katie Celia Simone came over at 9 with a live chicken and we took it to the chapel.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m exhibiting behavior on account of being lonely, or stressed.</description>

      <description>#newsong concept:
gregor mendel was celebit his whole life - but the whole reason he loved breeding plants was because he was a homosexual. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t be gay back then so he redirected his homo desires into plants.
But it took one special night to start doing this.
And he was a conflicted priest for a few years, and then one summer night snuck out and hit the city for the weekend.</description>

A solid morning.
Caputed by the buddhists, I asked if it was church and Tracy laughed and told me it&amp;rsquo;s more of a meeting. Soka Gakkai Interational (SGI) Nam myoho renge kyo contains the very essense of the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s lifetime of teachings. B chanting Nam myoho renge kyo and inspiring hope in others, we manifest the unlimited potential of our lives and become the starting point for a peaceful society.</description>

Find myself on the 17 again. No headphones today because I want to just hear everything. I went overboard on music the past week, and one of the mushroom nights I went down the rabbit hole imagining that I disrecpected music for too long, and now am paying the price for it.

Really going through a rut&amp;hellip;
I can&amp;rsquo;t admit what&amp;rsquo;s happening even in poliwat.
The key to naviagting with reality is to not care. Not care in a sense that you&amp;rsquo;re able to allow eveything to happen to you.
Poliwat is the one way I can organize my mind, and ensure that I&amp;rsquo;m on the right path. Yesterday I attempted to smoke as much weed as I possibly could.</description>

In the first hour of hanging out with this old indian dude in the sun by the jacoozi, I got a real sad spell. I became attached to him too quick, and thought how he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much time left. It made me so sad, because the light in him shines brighter than anyone I&amp;rsquo;ve seen here.
We shared a spliff and talked about everything. He affirmed that life is but a stage.</description>

I submitted to darkness, the past few days have been a blur. I wasted Monday-now. But I had a real nice time having a solid hangout session with Darlene, we hiked around my house and I showed her classified liC. Addy fucked me so hard I have wanted to kill myself consistently since Sunday. Also Matt was the worst house guest, but he just got out of a relationship with Kim after 4 1&amp;frasl;2 years so it&amp;rsquo;s understandable.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s my Bday.
I have a glorious 1 hour off and it feel amazing.
This has been my first week working as a Naturalist. I love it so much! The kids are great, yesterday after we caught salamanders, they all held out their hands for diet hot cheetos (which are carrots). And I threw them all over them, and they landed in the dirt. Then the kids joined the super secret dirty carrot club, and they took turns throwing dirty carrots into my mouth to eat.</description>

@ starbucks, got a ride from Niko to Los Gatos, now I&amp;rsquo;ll splurge the 18 bucks for a lyft to get to the station. I&amp;rsquo;m not making any money after it&amp;rsquo;s all said and done, but getting 50 bucks to record a podcast is still great cause it pays for transportation and food for the day, and I get to edit my audio the rest of the day.</description>

On the stage at my new house. The last 48 hours was insane! I spent 101 buck at grocery outlet, and have been at my house all weekend. Spent from dawn to the time I passed on music yesterday. Made about 30 minutes of radio. Pretty fast pace, my workflow has gotten much faster.
however the inner junky in me won, and I day drank smoked and did some extra credit drugs as well.</description>

@ Peter&amp;rsquo;s cafe right at the milbrae station. Got a ride from my new buddy Kiev to the North Berkeley BART, he got off at 16th and mission to hit the city with old college friends.
I&amp;rsquo;d rather pay 10 bucks and sit at this cafe while waiting the hour for the caltrain over taking a taxi, this is much nicer. Then I get to be on my laptop for both.</description>

CAMP WAS SO FUN There&amp;rsquo;s so many cool people here, it&amp;rsquo;s unreal. About to get a ride from Kiev to San Fran, where I&amp;rsquo;ll probably jump on Caltrain (or hang with gusTedCam for a few hours), where I&amp;rsquo;ll deep clean.
Now it&amp;rsquo;s all about, clean moving and applying for 3 places:</description>

Slept in the theatre last night with pero. The whole TSS crew did tech rehearsal until like 3 AM - so matt and I just crashed there. It was a good move, cause I was able to wake up early, drive over and buy a go pro hero 4 off Kyle from letgo, and get some footage. Had a nice talk with a man at a lablabyrinthrythnh outside some real nice cathedral close to Pine street.</description>

FIRE AUDIO!!!! Been getting great clips around here.
Had a nice V day in SC. Me Ian and Nick made a beat.
Last night I walked down to the stage at midnight last night. I started a little fire but put it out cause there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much good firewood around.
This morning I was waiting at the bus stop but a dude came driving by in a forerunner, so I hitched a ride with him.</description>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t say hi but did say &amp;lsquo;god bless you&amp;rsquo;. She&amp;rsquo;s grading papers from section, just like when I was in the course. She got more stylin for sure. Not that she ever wasn&amp;rsquo;t.

On Caltrain, heading to meet cam. We&amp;rsquo;re getting haircuts today! The plumber that came this morning was talking to Jack&amp;rsquo;s mom about moving within the next year. He placed the house at about 2.3 million, where I&amp;rsquo;m crashing. In a late night episode, I was looking up the prices of places in CA, and San Mateo it about the 3rd most expensive place in the state.

4 all nighters in a row; today has been a blur at best. Had a nice little practice with Jack in the local park close to his house.
The application for this grad program is due Feb 14th, basically a week from now because I need to mail it.
That puts me in a little bit of a time crunch.
Tonight is a media night!

to all the people that said I wouldn&#39;t amount to anything I still havent given up  3 all nighters in a row, going on 4 tonight.
I am v stressed cause I did a solid first episode for my radio show,

when you do something abnormally good,
you need to do better that next week,
so I won&amp;rsquo;t sleep much

I can healthily say I&amp;rsquo;m disapointed in myself.
But I got great tape doing an interview with Mitch.
Tonight I&amp;rsquo;m interviewing Moxie.
The RULE that I learned fucking TWICE - don&amp;rsquo;t get high before interviews.
It&amp;rsquo;s only their graciousness that carries it.
So when I want something, I need to get in the habit of mentally postponing it,
I have gotten so stuck

I&amp;rsquo;m going to try something new. Instead of getting high, I will do something new. Looking over the past month I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the time to regulate substances, and have been made noticeable improvement. I have now made it about 5 days since my last tobacco hit and so I may be in the clear. It&amp;rsquo;s been hard at times being around many friends with countless substance opportunities.</description>

So last night my cousin R called me. He&amp;rsquo;s a military guy on the east coast. We had the most HILARIOUS and loving short talk, best tape of my life. I was recording but had the gain on the mic at 0, so I got none of it.
These are are the moments you become used to when chasing tape. Cause tape can&amp;rsquo;t be chased. You can only set the parameters of the situation, that&amp;rsquo;s when the best tape occurs.</description>

Best YT comment I&amp;rsquo;ve seen AHAHAHA
I&#39;ve been programming for 19 years. People think creating AI with self modifying code is really difficult when the development of AI has only been limited by CPU power. Its actually quite easy, that&#39;s why its so scary. Genetic Algorithms are mostly a copy paste job, the only programming that is required is figuring out the heuristic. They are extremely simple by virtue of the fact that it can basically start with nothing and will always eventually get the result you want in a semi brute force fashion, the only factor is time.</description>

When I woke up I saw a daisy And it reminded me of when I was a kid When I was 13 I got my mom flowers to Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any money so I stole them from Walmart My mom found out I stole them and Took us both back to Walmart She had me return the flowers to the manager and she gave me money to buy her flowers And she said This is how you buy flowers</description>

I feel like trash, and rightly so. I accidentally backed up my bus into Todd&amp;rsquo;s side door when I was realigning it for the lift.
All shop trust was wiped at that.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing a schedule tonight, and am going to nail these projects.
This is the place for the schedule at first, and it will be moved to a calendar.
I have been writing a lot in other places outside of poliwat&amp;hellip; I have a full SD card of fresh audio collected throughout the last week.</description>

Dear parents,
I declare myself in a state of emergency!
I have managed to shower, eat well, work and play so far. Today is day 1 of complete sobriety.
We are having this meeting because you expressed concern. That&amp;rsquo;s great! Because I could really use some help.
One must listen before they help, so I wrote down an overview of my work.
I feel overwhelmed, and you will soon see why.</description>

Haven&amp;rsquo;t written much in poliwat because I started a secret project I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about. I&amp;rsquo;m publishing a book anonymously, it has 10,000 words so far. Wrote it all in one all nighter last Friday night. That&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ll say about it.
The piano has been drinking. The audio I got yesterday:
2-3 people moved my recorder while it was in place. Ahahahaha too bad.

Spent the morning finishing Joey&amp;rsquo;s site, then working on the innovators podcast. Both are basically done, and I need to more my body. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to freak out. Going to go swim 1 mile and workout in the sauna.
I wish I could find my lucy
333 PM
Worked out real hard at the Y.
Someone stole my goggles in the locker room while I was in the sauna warmup before swimming.</description>

On Caltrain heading to Aren&amp;rsquo;s talk. Listening to Avery&amp;rsquo;s mixes.
I got great tape last night but can&amp;rsquo;t share it on here. After Asim dropped me back home from NB at abou 1130PM, I realized I left my lappy. He picked my dumbass up a second time and we drove all the way back to grab it, because in his words &amp;ldquo;You told me your laptop was your life&amp;rdquo;.</description>

 Asim picked me up from Stanford after I got a little tape reading TSS, and on our way to NB he took me to a place called Scrap, and it was fucking sick.
Purchased the case for my new Midi controller, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be made using the extra parts I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated. I&amp;rsquo;m drawing out the schematic and laser cutting wood for the thing. In a 3D printing / Modeling class here at NB and it&amp;rsquo;s about to get started.</description>

Spent the morning writing for the choir
The hole in my intestines deepened at the purchase of another train ticket on my credit card.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing music as if my life depended on it.
How can I do this quicker?
Writing the voicings using just simple operator in Ableton, quantizing, then importing that midi to musescore.</description>

Last night auditions went well - but I am getting off topic lately. Last night I went all out into a Davinci resolve editing tutorial, because Rob recommended I try to forget about premiere and final cut.</description>

      <description>media gets Fragmented
A speaker tells a listener what someone did to get what he wanted and why.
Once a character has a desire, the story &amp;ldquo;walks&amp;rdquo; on two &amp;ldquo;legs&amp;rdquo;: acting and learning. A character pursuing a desire takes actions to get what he wants, and he learns new information about better ways to get it. Whenever he learns new information, he makes a decision and changes his course of action.</description>

I woke up from 3 bad dreams on the trampoline. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling quite lonely. My dad is cursing and is angry about being late to work. The moment he comes home from his job he turns off and veggetizes. We rarely play music together.
Why should I feel depressed? I successfully launched two sites and applied to about 30 jobs yesterday.</description>

I have to have to be honest. Other than logging an audio trail, this diary is a tool for me to make better decisions. It was MONDAY when I started my portfolio site, and now I&amp;rsquo;m sitting here and it&amp;rsquo;s late Thursday morning. I woke up on the trampoline falling asleep to Joe Rogon and Neil de Grasse Tyson. At about 1:20:50 Tyson talks about the importance of the naming of stuff, which clearly explains to me why the Illest Village project works.</description>

Last night I planted some iceplant Paul gave me in my parents backyard. It&amp;rsquo;s always good to plant on the side.
This morning started with a quick look into Samuel Beckett and three Jays. JK, not marijuana but James Joyce, and Jane Austin.
Quick nugs from School of life and my own understanding:
Sammuel Beckett  likes to write around the word &#39;perhaps&#39; not specific, allowing viewer to make it specific on their own  James Joyce  Everyday losers are just as epic and interesting as rich / heroes / heroines.</description>

I must admit here that I could be going faster. But I got distracted by the school of life&amp;rsquo;s art and Architecture educational videos on youtube.
Good design:[10]  is innovative – The possibilities for progression are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs. But imaginative design always develops in tandem with improving technology, and can never be an end in itself.</description>

Since today the world is ending, the only sane task at hand is to do what I love. I will build poliwat, and then travel the world with it. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple. It&amp;rsquo;s not that simple though because although the code compiles, I can&amp;rsquo;t get anything out of the LCD screen at the moment&amp;hellip;</description>

creation spawns from chaos
creating aand trading realities as art
life and the imagination is this oric field that surrounds the transcendential object
239 pm
only poliwat
I have cut off all contact with everyone at this point. I will do the bare minimum communications. The only contact is with my parents here. Other than that I am entering complete isolation with myself and poliwat.
This week is devoted to building muscles, and not just physical.</description>

Woke up very depressed
I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to move to San Mateo today. The plan is to start with getting a credit card at Wells Fargo, so I can rent the uhaul. You can&amp;rsquo;t rent a uhaul without a credit card. Then I just have to pack up whats in my room and head up there. But really I&amp;rsquo;d rather turn off my phone, keep my blinds shut, and work on poliwat.</description>

Dienrich&amp;rsquo;s diary
“Nowadays, the prevailing view is that you should authentically rejoice and celebrate the spiritual happiness that this era has to offer, for it is a gift! People need to think about how many challenges the world has faced and how many obstacles and dreadful dangers it has overcome. They no longer believe that it is temporal distance that embellishes things, persons and situations and what makes difficulties and problems fade away and be forgotten.</description>

      <description>I discovered one of the biggest thrills.
But first I will begin with the start of the night, at an old engineer type friend named Thomas from back in my Community College days. He held the BBQ at a house real close to one of the elementary schools I went to. It was interesting because I remember doing motocross as a kid with a friend that used to live there. There used to be a huge nice dirt motocross track in the backyard, but it had since been bulldozed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m broke because I stopped working my web development job over a month ago. I&amp;rsquo;m out of money. I&amp;rsquo;m on a spending freeze. Being home is useful for that.
We were joking the other night and Chad said a good one &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so broke my most broke friend said I was broke&amp;rdquo;
When you are this broke you can see price tags on all your possessions. I made a pact to sell anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t related to Poliwat.</description>

Today I found out the real founder of 911 was blind, and he spent some time in New York.
Moving and cleaning the room Day 2, very deep in it.
Moving gives you an air of sentiment. There are great as well as painful memories, and they&amp;rsquo;re all treasured. The time capsule box has been selected and I have my items chosen to go inside, a fake degree Sean the provost handed me at graduation, and unopened Yoshi toy from Mcdonalds.</description>

Captured memories is a main quest in Zelda. You need to find these 12(or 13?) lost memories across the expansive regions of the game.
Operation Captured Memories is the new official code name for the time capsule that we are burying at a graveyard in a couple weeks. So far this is what the box has:
 graduation certificiate from UCSC (which I&amp;rsquo;ll write a letter to my future self on) yoshi model from Mcdonalds little note I left for Tara (Jordan Lipaz&amp;rsquo;s GF) when I visited her trailer at the trailer park  &amp;lt;!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m getting stuck on Ashley&amp;rsquo;s Photography work. I can&amp;rsquo;t look away! If she had a genre of photos I would call it sexy magic. She exploits the setting around these people to look much more attractive and magical than they&amp;rsquo;re probably treated. The hopeless romantic in me says the magic and beauty are already there, while she uses photography to show and remind others of it.
Future tracks will have track art from Ashley and will be notated as such.</description>

      <description>it feels good  -16 days sober A quick analysis of an online journal. Currently there are less than 10 readers (the latest being a 71 year old woman) I&amp;rsquo;m finding that there are experiences that need to be documented, but are disadvantageous to write. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a good journal without the experiences that matter to me, so it&amp;rsquo;s a huge disservice to leave those experiences out. I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with simply hiding that content so I can find it at a later date easily but users won&amp;rsquo;t see it.</description>

Monday 12 47 AM
What can I say. Woke up on a beach by mad river. The sun shone through the fog, and I recorded this:
 Stefan Jack and I skinny dipped in the ocean. There was a fisherman right next to us who got disgusted and left. We had a hilarious and exciting breakfast in Arcata. I haven&amp;rsquo;t recorded much on account of dead batteries after the ocean.</description>

And if I don&amp;rsquo;t there will be a catalog of working documenting my journey. It&amp;rsquo;s all about making tracks based off audio collected from the day.

The 12 steps to better abs.
Abs Anonymous.
And it started because for years, I have been keeping tabs on others with the same name as me, Michael Betts. Mostly to feel better about myself, but also I have this fantasy where we can all start a think tank and solve the world&amp;rsquo;s issues. Or even better not solve them and make a show of our attempts.</description>

The soundscapes are from our professor and mentor David Dunn, and the woman speaking is my relative Cathy Nelson. Her work is so inspiring an entire album could be made from it.</description>

 I&amp;rsquo;ve been at work since 10 AM and have virtually gotten nothing done. (For my job at least). I can&amp;rsquo;t concentrate to save my life. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to post some stuff up online to sell.
I can&amp;rsquo;t work because life is short. I have songs to work on. I can&amp;rsquo;t stop.
I&amp;rsquo;m a slave. I&amp;rsquo;m a slave to the beat. The family reunion trip changed my mindset.</description>

      <description>Sunday 1134 AM A golden rule of writing is to choose specific over vague. The drunk shaman would not appreciate my sharing about them online so I will be vague. You are unstoppable when you have a drunken shaman.
Instead of talking about it I&amp;rsquo;m working on a track. This is the master doc for lyrics and iterations on the music.

      <description>Another unfinished project, but the idea is
song involving the final stage of life, and the lryics are basically your final will and testament. I imagine myself would be angry on my deathbed, and anger is an abstraction from fear. I have too many ideas to execute in one life, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m angry.
I&amp;rsquo;m freestyling on this version. I was actually lying down on my back, in the dark.</description>

Peter hasn&amp;rsquo;t called back again - I called him yesterday.
Chad said he was going to be home in 30 and we were going to walk the neighbor&amp;rsquo;s dogs together. He never showed up and I&amp;rsquo;ve called 3 times. I&amp;rsquo;m very depressed. It&amp;rsquo;s day 2 of sobriety, and my only drug has been in how the day was spent. I worked on the Betts family renunion album from 8am - 6pm.</description>

In the meantime I will share a gem I don&amp;rsquo;t want to forget - Tommy Betts the man who mentored my dad in music, and my father. I&amp;rsquo;m playing some piano in the background, and the recorder I left on their table.</description>

      <description>My dad and I went to checkout a guitar on craigslist today. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;instrumental&amp;rsquo; that we get a guitar on this trip, because the magic and emotions have been running high so far.
We had a great time with him, spent 20 minutes cracking jokes and BSing. Erik is hilarious. Towards the end of the transaction, Erik handed me the jacket seen in the picture above. It is my new favorite jacket, and I&amp;rsquo;m dedicating my next track to Erik.</description>

      <description>Just jumped in the ocean and practiced handstands. This guy showed me how to go from your butt to a handstand There are different types of breathing.
 Square breathing
  In middle school my therapist (whose email was hypnohupp) taught me square breathing.
You inhale for 10 seconds, hold for 10, exhale for 10, hold for 10, rinse and repeat.
I like to start at 5 seconds and then increase the time after a few cycles through.</description>

I got her though  this was recorded on the sixth floor of a stairwell at my uni dorms. I was messing with a made-up, by ear tuning. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what key this is. I&amp;rsquo;m tone deaf.</description>

      <description>had 2 beers last night Currently working on a trap song with lyrics exploring the perspective of not being born yet, and not necessarily wanting to be born. Since you&amp;rsquo;re constrained to the reality of our politics, biology, and paradigms; such as religion, capitalism, etc.
current state  I got the idea at my sister&amp;rsquo;s house, when I took an image of her sonogram and ran it through a max msp patch that converted the image data to MIDI.</description>

      <description>300 gigs of my own personal audio recordings.  ^ fav atm
Saturday 116 AM
The biggest treasure of my life is my recordings. I collect audio every day. Normal slice of life things. I constantly record people without them knowing. I call it guerilla audio, and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop. You can tell me it&amp;rsquo;s immoral, illegal, douchie, lock me up, kick my ass, and I still won&amp;rsquo;t stop.</description>

      <description>the center of github
 I have a romantic thought. What’s at the center of Github? I imagine a room where someone makes beats as a 9-5. These beats help fuel the rest of the programming community. This person makes an instrumental track for each git command. Each track has it’s stems available on github.
My day job right now is web development. I am a primarily self taught programmer. I haven’t gone beyond doodling.</description>

Friday 533 PM | OnCalTrain | JULY 28 2017 | #####I your therapist at wits end
Had 1 beer @ [jack&amp;rsquo;s]() house and we livestreamed the Sims 3 on Twitch as prep for our play. Just wanted to report on an occurrence that happened a couple months ago. After my last breakup, I went a little off the rails. No, not talking ruby, I maintained a healthy ecosystem of smoke and drink each day.</description>

      <description>I always wished I grew up in a household like this. I wanted nothing more than a laptop since the age of 6, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get my hands on a computer until some extreme manipulation in seventh grade. I got a shitty Dell that would run World of Warcraft at 12 FPS in Ogrimmar or Dalaran. I was an incredibly annoying lock for a while but my real soul was ganking, dueling and general pvping as an undead rogue.</description>

A major client we have here has a major page down for their international (french site). I really had to shit and drink coffee so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t much help and now I should be working on fixing that, but am also consulting my buddy tyler on some flexbox use for a client of his.
Going to Michigan on Tuesday, so real quick notes, these things have to happen today -</description>

Every week at my work there&amp;rsquo;s an hour where you can share your projects / ideas over free coffee and snacks. I go for the free coffee and snacks.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have any new ideas but listening to all my unfinished beats.
// need to make more music
 Yesterday I failed at making live loops because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have good old DJ Chad Mike hitting record for me.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to type anymore. I&amp;rsquo;ve been sober for a full 7 days now, and I&amp;rsquo;m pissed. I am angry. I will use this anger to get shit done, like log work hours, work on music
Todd hooked me up big time at the fab lab, and I met Chris and Jordan. Chris Maddox printed the first versions of POLIWAT for me and I&amp;rsquo;m super amped on it.</description>

At Diridon in San Jose. Hopefully the 17 bus comes and I&amp;rsquo;ll get to my place in Santa Cruz before midnight. My laptop charging porter burned out while on the train so this is the last charge until I repair it. I found a shop in San Jose that has a new pot I can install myself for 40 bucks.</description>
