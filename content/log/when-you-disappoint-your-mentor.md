**Tuesday 613 PM**

I feel like trash, and rightly so.
I accidentally backed up my bus into Todd's side door when I was realigning it for the lift.

All shop trust was wiped at that.


I'm writing a schedule tonight, and am going to nail these projects.

This is the place for the schedule at first, and it will be moved to a calendar.

I have been writing a lot in other places outside of poliwat... I have a full SD card of fresh audio collected throughout the last week.
Listening to Jimmy on vinyl and he's high out of his mind in between songs.


Goals:
### December 5th - January 5th:
* best shape of my life
* weekly selling laser cut art
* all TSS memorized
* Budgeting myself ( I know how much I need to make each week, I know how much I can spend each day, I am on a saving plan )
* Have Applied to at least 1 Graduate Program ( DANM )

### January 5th - February 5th:

### February 5th - March 5th:
* My book is complete and available online

### March 5th - April 5th:

635 I'm so

overwhelmed at my projects, I need to organize and focus what is going down.

## What needs to happen master doc.

Realistic Schedule for the next 30 days.
Clearly defined hoops I gotta hop through

My hoops
Your hoops
& hula hooping

mantra of the 1000
I will hop 1000 hoops

tomorrow, because it's hard enough to write
tomorrow, because it may not happen tomorrow
tomorrow, because that's not a guarantee


Print TSS Script from Chad's printer (he gets a copy too)
```


Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday

Laser Cut Business fully launched by Saturday the 16th.



Ravel is my new fav.


What needs to happen by the end of tomorrow:
