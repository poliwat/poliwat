**Sun 223 PM**

I played a live set at the third fern gully installment, it was sweet.

I britney spears'd it. I made a 30 min music video / ableton mix. I didn't do any live looping like I wanted but did had a nice ratio of 40% written and 60% freestyle throughout the set.

The reception was real next level - people really loved that shit. I'm definitely on to something I don't understand, and I don't need to. It's probably best not to.

I stayed up all night by the sound system until about 11 AM, and freestyled a LOT. And my best freestyles weren't recorded, they were just a special treat to the few were were still present and awake.

My favorite part of the show was hanging out having hilarious conversations back stage with kenzie avery darlene and victor (and others who were around).
