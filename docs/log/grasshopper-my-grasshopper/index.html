<p>Song set in a meadow where I&rsquo;m walking, and asking a grasshopper I find for some life advice. I proceed to please my case. Grasshopper listens then gives me some generic advice response.</p>

<p>Game is to stick to this master / apprentice relationship with stuff. Keep it cool kung foo, karate kid, kill bill, etc&hellip;</p>

honestly honesty best policy when going out
holding hands in public

when i around
Get you off that couch make your moma proud
