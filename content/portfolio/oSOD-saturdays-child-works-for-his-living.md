yoga and pale blue morning with ted hel

this isn't even the right day but I'm just getting caught up in the sauce of it all. just talked to hunter and damn I have been so stupid this last week. I promised him I would live stream tomorrow by 7 pm so that'll be a deadline. it's perfect cause then I'll have that a stone's throw ( one click away ) from paleblue.fm or something, but probably just on the homepage || hunter hasn't been smoking weed which is real inspiring || I hit a moke earlier in celebration of entering a hackathon peter is hosting with a billion dollar idea. Now I just have to keep things simple and build it. I really am kicking myself for not jumping in the shower during primetime, this brain of mine has gone deep down a rabbit hole and I'm not going to get out until my mom has a beach house and I can sample her on bass over the waves outside. ||
