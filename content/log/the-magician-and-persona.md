**Wed 4AM**

Sleeping in Brian's living room. obsessed with this piano and my mom talking over Christmas break. I can't stop listening to this. I'll include in the first ep, it's going to be Midnight Mondays! Midnight is perfect because I can do the show as long as I like.  

I've been loving SF this last week, a lot. Tomorrow I need to really focus on dash n promoting


**Wednesday 930 AM**
