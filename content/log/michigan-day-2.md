Got audio of the Lake Superior. A new goal I have is to release my first album on spotify, and it's will simply be an album of different bodies of water I've recorded ğŸ”¥ğŸ’§ğŸ˜‚.


##### This morning was monumental. I met the most family members in my entire life.

##### We hit the bar Flannigan's ( right next door to the house my dad gew up in ) then the graveyard.

That's my grandparents graves on my dad's side.
