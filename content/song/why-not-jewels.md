#### Lyrics

```
(why not)
v1

why not
dad was an asshole
mom fucking talked a load
damn so why you think that
I got no sniffles
cept when I jog oh cinco de miles
that's for fine file
where the necklace isn't my haah
I got your jewels
you taught me strings
I got six of them
me and my hand and my dickie
old ray used to say
you were such a slut
but I did better
by dividing the cunts

(jack)
mom was an asshole
she made me feel worthless  


(andrew)
why
why do they spread all the lies
I just watch the news till I die
all I wanna do it get high
why
I dont even really know


```
