take death in pride

My cat died a few a couple months ago. It occurred around the time that %^&#$% broke up with me. I haven't talked about it since, but being home the past few days I was reminded how much I missed her. { The cat, not my X }


Some
tape of my crying mom plus drunk best childhood friend talking of the recent death of our lovely cat, panda


Driving to the DMV with Chad now. I need to get a license before hitting Michigan tomorrow with my dad. I am going to sneak some lucy on the plane.

I'm a little behind schedule with **Github . center**

Why am I obsessed with working on my weaknesses? I need to just make music, and focus on nothing else.
