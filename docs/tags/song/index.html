                                  miss myself missing you - poliw.at [early release] 13:03
Freewrite #123089 &lsquo;What a piece of work is man? Washing up dishes this morning plotting how to cut my dick off, I get too horny too often for this lifestyle. But it teaches patience, my current best reason to look forward to aging. Some men say it doesn&rsquo;t go away. Well yeah that&rsquo;s probably right, but you have more time to develop your interests.

Never drank in a whole foods
so its fitting first time you get drunk then tpy 200 words
a minute it feels plans out the window
80 words a minute it is
but feels 200 plus 3 tips
and an open card means I&rsquo;m leaving happy
and my money isn&rsquo;t anything
doesn&rsquo;t meant anything
is nothing
in the land of the rich
and the free
until dont&rsquo; have any

 (verse 1) I was wandering in my head even though I'm tired tired you came wandering like a Pokemon you would always lie high in the grass just like a lazy Snorlax z z z you could be a Butterfree (verse 2) you came a running cause there was a spider all up in your face face I latched on quick like a Bulbasaur now we are face to face (reprise) ho ho ho ho kisses are wet ho ho ho ho kisses fucking sting (bridge) the moment you get outa that existential funk the moment you stop seeing that punk (build up fast part) (( all a big &gt; )) we can and we can talk and have a platonic relationship in the back of my bus cause everything is cool and everything is great when we live in a world where no one master bates and if you go to church and compartmentalize your life and do what your told and your told to be a wife the rich are getting richer and the poor always want more so lets just pop some molly and hit the dance floor (verse 3) fee fie foe fum here comes my girlfriend and I think she's mad at me there's diminishing returns on apologies so I say sorry strategically but ho ho ho ho kisses are wet ho ho ho ho kisses fucking sting

                                  miss myself missing you - poliw.at [early release] 13:03
Freewrite #123089 &lsquo;What a piece of work is man? Washing up dishes this morning plotting how to cut my dick off, I get too horny too often for this lifestyle. But it teaches patience, my current best reason to look forward to aging. Some men say it doesn&rsquo;t go away. Well yeah that&rsquo;s probably right, but you have more time to develop your interests.

Never drank in a whole foods
so its fitting first time you get drunk then tpy 200 words
a minute it feels plans out the window
80 words a minute it is
but feels 200 plus 3 tips
and an open card means I&rsquo;m leaving happy
and my money isn&rsquo;t anything
doesn&rsquo;t meant anything
is nothing
in the land of the rich
and the free
until dont&rsquo; have any

 walking talking smiling keeping things close to my chest you can always lie on my chest wen you're feeling stressed when you're feeling blessed but london bridges london bridges but london bridges fall london bridges london bridges london bridges fall (breakdown) shaving legs and I sense change cause you don't shave your legs nearly as much as you used to and seasons change and you look great but don't rely just on your looks girl cause that is lame oh and we go and play twister in the middle of the night and after 3 or 4 beers we're having a fight cause you want to play some monopoly but be with my girl I'll monopolize your pussy (surprise) I come in late at night you look stunning when the lights when the lights aren't so bright one step two grab myself a drink while you are watching tv and there's a man on the scren and he's telling me things I should eat and also medication so I can digest thoes things but is that man on the screen gonna fix what's between you you you you and me (whisper) and me so fuck it go!
