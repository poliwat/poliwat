[[
Now the world is full of pussies and soy boys and the anger that would have helped has been hindered because we are under attack by something || and what the bible is so correct about is completely wrong and wrong in it’s own unique right. the fact stands that other entities exist, that the universe as we know it is but a fraction of the actual universe, that angels demons and aliens can be one in the same or all or none, that the governments of the world are sweating 24 7 to ensure the survival of our species,

and then there’s the extra credit sort of life.
