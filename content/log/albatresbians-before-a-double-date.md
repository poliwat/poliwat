**Tuesday 6:45 PM**

Find myself in BMC for the first time in years.

Had a fun set practicing with Poliwat with Cripi last night on my show. We started around 1AM, before that I spun Jack's Eve Online Podcast and it was sick!!! I'm so proud of him, it's prefoessional.

### After landing @ empire studios

On campus for t-minus 3 minutes and I find myself in the front row of a lecture.
We parted in for <a href="https://www.christianheadlines.com/news/can-animals-be-gay-11628683.html">thisreading. </a> Everyone is stoned and they suck at reading outloud, the class is about half opinion half research.  

I'm getting fire tpe like always, spent the morning
