*608 PM*

Enjoying the last night before a season of sobriety. This journals going to get lit.

Jack laid down the law over the phone earlier- I am to not piss his mom off, help clean out the garage, and do a list of chores. Oh and have a check ready for 200 bucks. What a deal! Jack is going to be my main mentor in these upcoming months, I can feel it.

I like to live life in season. I'm going to put everything into this play. I'm writing tunes for it and practicing my lines.

There won't be a serious log until moving in
Chad and I are about to leave for SC tonight with all my loot in my dad's van.
We're going to catch Steven Rodriguez's (top of most my electronic music classes) birthday. I can't wait!

When I come back I'll be focused

I will log my time
