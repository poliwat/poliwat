Jack and I just ate pizza @supreme. Why don't I work harder? I want to answer this question. Aside from being human. I have needs. I feel horny, hungry, and sleepy. We're about to head to rehearsal.


Audio lockdown - I need to get more efficient. work harder and smarter. While also enjoying myself along the way. What was that author that said something like life is easy to understand but terribly impossible to execute. I don't remember.

Fuck all the noise. I'll carve out my life to look like a waltz. My focus is in doing better than yesterday. I mitigate tricking myself by documentation.
```

Block first show
record all voicemails
practice my monologue
