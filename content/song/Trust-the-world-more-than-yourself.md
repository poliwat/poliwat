#### Lyrics

```
(chorus)
trust the world
just trust the world

v1
trust the world
more than you trust yourself
its close quarters
that are all seeing evil eye
with no vpn

(trust the world)
pants down
(trust the world)
using google chrome
(trust the world)
not knowing that's spyware
(trust the world)

trust you worl d
more than yuorself

if you couldnt trust yourself in school

trust the world
(just trust the world)
more than you trust yourself

just trust the world
just trust the world


```

that harsh reality
that only every cynical coach knows
you're never gonna make it
your species a disease
youll survive if you fake it
and fuck the news please
