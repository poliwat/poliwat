update I smoked all day and was an idiot by 10 pm - but Hunter and I hung out and max and we got a lot done -

hunter and I made a beat and I got a lot of momentum for poliwat.

He lent me his nice camera so no more excuses I can do this.

I can do better.

I don't know as I'm getting back into a sober groove right now, I like to think that the next lesson I need is always going to be in the next action. ( even shitty actions, it's hard to escape a lesson )

But I don't have a lack of actions. My body is sore. I perform a lot of tasks on most given days.

I don't know I think lock down is the only solution right now and one of the hardest parts is to enjoy the ride during the shitty parts


I fell asleep to RAMAT! on repeat. It's a simple beat where Tamar helped me play a polychord -
and her talking in the background from hanging out.


wow just found my 36 gb card in the makerspace filing cabinet. Fuck yeah!
