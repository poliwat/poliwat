hand written notes transcription:

liberty bell walk w/bags to Geno's down 9th

Met granny she said she's helen and called me a handsome bo
and told me to shave holed up

```
spanked man with a lamb
picasso don't give a damn
touched the thinker for a dollar
moment forgot but sold camera
video me this

I got that EBT
in that museum for free

just left rocky stairs
lookig at statues in the rain
never wne tinside
had to catch the train
to norfolk
home of the mermaid
