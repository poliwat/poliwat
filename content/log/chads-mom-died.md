**Monday 652 PM**

Chad's mom died peacefully in her sleep sometime inbetween 7 and 11 AM.

I was sanding this wooden island found by a dumpster while on a walk with my mom this morning, when
we saw the fire engine in his front yard and checked it out. There was a cop a healthcare lady and fire guys.

I was the first to call chad, he's in oceanside for a religious holiday. He's driving back tomorrow morning.
