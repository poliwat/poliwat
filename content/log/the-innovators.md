I'm in a lousy mood, don't want to be awake right now. But on the caltrain heading to the Stanford Radio station to help Tom (tim?) with a new show he's putting on. Also we'll talk about what he wants with the website, he may be a client.

Spent the morning writing for Celia's choir, it has consumed me.

Notable progress on paradiddles.

I hate everything

No one answered their phone except Chad

It'll get better when I'm in the studio. I think I'll be able to find it without google maps today. Could really use a talk with my sister right now.

The studio is one of the few (if only) places I can be totally sober right now. That and noisebridge is a sanctuary for attaining this.
