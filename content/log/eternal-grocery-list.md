Help me help me help me

I can't ask for help in person

I can't talk about certain things in person

Because I have so many barriers built up

in order to not go crazy ?

no I can talk about anything

I shouldn't take what I say too seriously coming out of this cannabis circus.

I'll be wrong about a good 3-4 thought rabbit holes before it starts getting legit.


I am terribly disappointed in myself.

I will say that. How much more disappointed could I get? I will go homeless for poliwat. I will go homeless for PBD. I just need help, I won't stop working on them. I'll go work on it in the public library if I have to.
