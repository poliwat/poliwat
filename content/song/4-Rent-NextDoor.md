( Time is now )

___
had a great yesterday night recorded the weiner circle after a nice intimate session at Lillys for the first time with ONE BEER
DRANK ONLY ONE BEER AND IT WAS THE BEST NIGHT but helen was sick so you know I had some extra energy

but got numbers from these two girls at the weiner circle it was sick --- we're going to record sometime this week and they said I was going to make it

and that I look like the baby of te bundy and jeffrey dahmer HAHAHAHA and damn we were showing each other songs and shit ... too goo best hotdog I've had in my life now, had it over rick and morty helen fell asleep to it she'd never seen it and I rewatched the first two episodes and LUB IT ++

++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++  just talked to aris and booyah got a little money in my pocket, enough to pay some people back and eat a hotdog so what more is there to life

my life spent so much time not being a songwriter only to come back writing songs. Can't escape it music is all there is
