#### Lyrics

```
Carter! Carter! Carter!
DID HE DID HE
// move with that attitude
DID HE
911 demolition
DID HE
false flag operation
DID HE
JFK assasination
I'm talking curtain call
for the curtain fall
girls go wild when the curtain up
men revolutionize to take that curtain down
I just wanna shower with you and anime
wow wow
I said it It meant it as everything as a pawn
I said it It meant it as everything as a pawn
I said it It meant it as everything as a pawn
I said it It meant it as everything as a pawn


I'm talking I'm talking curtain call for the curtain fall
it a party when the curtain up
girls revolutionize to take that curtain down
I just wanna shower with you
and anime wow wow
I said it I meant it as everything as a pawn
I said it I meant it as everything as a pawn
I said it I meant it as everything as a pawn
I said it I meant it as everything as a pawn

learn to love yourself buttercup
grab a partner you love make-up and no make-up
buttercup
grow up you grown up
don't kill that child inside of of you
that the most you you'll ever know
your short buy a cute pup

and you welcome here
cause it's curtain call for the curtain fall
fuck a hook read a book you got ADD
5150'd on my 21st birthday
life beyond fear
that's why they say I got acid eyes
fam's afraid to call me back like
from poor to bullied to popular to transcend 'I'

bullied into fear
deprogram the shill in your cheap thrills
that's making the world a shittier place
paradise is here always was here

most of the right pills for your body mind and soul
wont be legal
cause we're stuck in a master slave complex
abstracted away through lawyers and judges


once a week I stay up till dawn

------NOT BELOW THIS LINE ------
don't constrain your language
only sacred is nothing is sacred

have something to say about start ups
men revolutionize take that


max every emotion
throw me in coach

my world would crush your chest

why is nobody thining
am I gonna die a die a cynic
cause I'm not too smart
to correct these actions that are not


```
