*Friday 949 AM*

On Caltrain heading to Aren's talk.
Listening to Avery's mixes.

### I got great tape last night but can't share it on here.

After Asim dropped me back home from NB at abou 1130PM, I realized I left my lappy. He picked my dumbass up a second time
and we drove all the way back to grab it, because in his words "You told me your laptop was your life".

Worst case scenario is losing this lappy.

Doing autodesk fusion 360 last night was a blast. It was my second attempt at learning the software, and the guy teaching, Adrian made everything make so much sense. I'm drawing up from scratch a little module that will fit perfectly inside the cigar box, and I'm going to make a little drum MIDI pad with it. I will then make an instructable and share the code.

Very happy they started adding captions on the earth when you pass over major cities.... https://www.ustream.tv/nasahdtv

For the books, this is the first day I've noticed this. And I've been checking out the ISS live stream for at least 4 years. Prolly 5 who cares...
