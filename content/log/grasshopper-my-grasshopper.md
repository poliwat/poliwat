Song set in a meadow where I'm walking, and asking a grasshopper I find for some life advice. I proceed to please my case. Grasshopper listens then gives me some generic advice response.

Game is to stick to this master / apprentice relationship with stuff. Keep it cool kung foo, karate kid, kill bill, etc...

The grasshopper said:

don’t get stoned throw stones from your glass house
you see life glass half empty though yo martini a fullhouse

you see life you see life glass half empty though yo martini a fullhouse

grasshopper he said
the early bird catches the worm you lost your way my friend
you see I live a shorter life
full of strife, I think I might
die in the next 18 minutes I
am old for my species gotta lot on my mind

only crickets will listen when humans leave us alone
but I digress I lament I repent my advice
not much but you’ll do fine

hop with your hips out
jump in the pull don’t walk now
you can’t make an omlete without breaking some eggs
honestly honesty best policy when going out
holding hands in public

grass is always greener
ass is always leaner
when i around
Get you off that couch make your moma proud

better ganja

she carries me pigeon towed up to my post office
just a hop skip and a jump friend
