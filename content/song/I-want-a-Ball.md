> lyrics:

```
C            Am
I want a ball to toss around
C            Am7
like when I was small
C            Am
like when I was small
C            Am7
knock knock knock
C            Am
I live next door and every moment
C            Am7
I see I see uniqueness
F         G       F            G7
and I see suffering under your eyelids
C            Am
I want a ball just to toss around
C            Am7
I want a ball just to toss around

so lets play tags with the neighbor kids
I'll hide in the trash then pop out real quick
we're gonna die soon so don't be a bitch
that's what life is I don't have perfect pitch

```
