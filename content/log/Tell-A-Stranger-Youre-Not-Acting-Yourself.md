Great mothers day, sent mom her video I made her, helped helen make an audio project for her mom, and walked with gina and becca for over an hour so gina could buy a bike, and filmed a bunch, then becca and I made BLTs for everyone and then me helen and becca hit the park and had a nice time - it was a much needed day of rest. Vunderbar!
