> Artist writeup:

> The philosophy behind Github has been a big inspiration as a digital media artist

> Each track is a git command line, the idea being an instrumental track you can hit play on whenever you need that command.

> Tracks are all free and open source, and some of the STEMS(the ones that didn't get lost on my broken laptop) are available here <a src="https://archive.org/details/SiliconDarwinismV2">  @archive </a>
