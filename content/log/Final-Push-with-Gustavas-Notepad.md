```
haven't hit it in a while
if hitting it was logs
cause it's finish album time
I have most the equipment I need
aside from the stems and reaktor 6
so I can't get the stems from any of the original tracks
but I can do my best with what I have
and just release it play it live and make more
no more sitting on tracks!!!!
too many  tracks!!!!
like a dragon sleeping on gold
destined to be attacked when you don't
give out the gold
you can only sleep on gold long enough
and you'll be slaughtered
as you watch it
being taken from you

If I was a square
for you I'd be there
