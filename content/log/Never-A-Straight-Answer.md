Well she's not in the best mood but its all good she's writing through it. I'm bouncing some old piano tape, going to put a classical ish ep up on distrokid.

Just got back to emma's apartment, spent the day painting the side of Aris's outside building on the roof of the neighbors. Great Chicago weather, wonderful time working in silence. Made a bunch of plans in my head, like getting 100 tracks up through distrokid, then making a bunch more. Where are those goals I loved though? I need to go look for them.
