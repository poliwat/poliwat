# Why is separation and divorce so hard ?

Letter to becca
but I left it at home
in beethovens letters
agter rubbing stone

rubbing it down in stone


## People are allowed to change their minds.

### STATS ARE RACIST

"""""
In California, prior to my daughter being born, I declined the DNA collection for my daughter. The medical staff went professionally ballistic when I said no. What the state and the hospitals don't tell you is that after the DNA sample has been collected it "may be sold for research." This DNA sample is then sold from the state to "researchers" from $20-$40. From there it can be sold to health marketing companies to insurance companies. No thanks...
