my worl crush your chest
my world can&rsquo;t pay rent
my world live off women
my world uplift women
my world clean and eat
my world work and clean
my world ciggie quitting
dirty addict past unforgiven
by god
cept everyone can&rsquo;t catch up with god
stuck up in their box
with they mind on locks
I use no glock
nearly killed myself</p>

<p>walked up
rails of bridges
too high for me
just to feel this free
live what you preach with who you love
live to learn teach when asked cuz</p>

<p>as a kid
showered with goggles
and a bathing suit</p>

<p>now I&rsquo;m climbing 60 foot trees</p>

<p>as a kid
I slept with all lights on all night
now I&rsquo;m diving mine shafts petting sleeping bats
&lsquo;bandoned mercury mine shafts
bever giving out
jig of rossi on way to the caves
fresh aircooled engine
in 71 bus
thank God Todd baskin
taught me to install it
swapped engines just to hit it big in the cruz
better I got at life worse I got at school
no more 80 bucks an hour
to listen to some fool
two thirds underpaid brain under fig newton tree
no one mentioned tesla nough now the car
stole his shadow
they took a great genius
hid his work
now you only know him as an electric car<br />
how the fuck you going to learn that in school
aiming for the stars<br />
materialism taught
in every nested meaning
see through this
do something good for yourself
drop out
watch free lectures and practicing thinking</p>

<p>learn how to memorize well</p>

<p>practice memorizing</p>

<p>eat shit good for your brain</p>

<p>always have something you&rsquo;re reading</p>

<p>not cereal boxes</p>

<p>get addicted to that brain strain</p>

<p>like a noodle in your face if your face was a skull</p>

<p>{{ this big nooddle on patrol }}</p>

<p>know</p>

<p>&lsquo;</p>

<p>as a kid</p>
