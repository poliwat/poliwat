Making pasta forgot what I was originally going to write to start this but it was a lot more important than making pasta

listening to bob dylan in 1075 and yeah I agree with my dad he sucks so I have high hopes I suck at singing but can write a song as if it's taking a piss so we're in good company America
|| so no jokes aside had a great day with helen we rode divvys and saw david shileds twice
