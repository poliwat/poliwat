A quick analysis of an online journal. Currently there are less than 10 readers (the latest being a 71 year old woman)
I'm finding that there are experiences that need to be documented, but are disadvantageous to write. It isn't a good journal without the experiences that matter to me, so it's a huge disservice to leave those experiences out. I've been experimenting with simply hiding that content so I can find it at a later date easily but users won't see it.
