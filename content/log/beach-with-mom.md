Saturday 1017 AM

In the car heading to the beach with my mom.

I feel like bob dylan. Cause I only cut the nails on my left hand.

Back from beach walk. My parents marriage is crumbling. I can help by clearing out my old room so that my mom can rent it out. I'll do that today. Also I'm dropping the Michigan Album today. I bet 12 people will listen to it.

 Got audio from Pismo Beach, one of my old stomping grounds as a kid. I'm releasing an album of just water pretty soon, because it's hilarious. I will get that as the first 'music' on spotify that I have up.

 Aside from that now it's all about finishing the center of github (stefan will surely help thank god), and continuiing on POLIWAT. I was so much happier on vacation not having to work, and I truly hate my job. I was able to spend every spare moment editing audio, and consequetively got the best audio of my life over and over again.

 There's a positive correlation between journalling and drugs, because I smoked and drank every day on vacation (not huge amounts), and had scant journalling. That's also because there was very little laptop time, and when there was I was editied audio or making music for the album.  



I can say
There's nothing worse than a marriage of convenience, and my parent's was never ever that.
