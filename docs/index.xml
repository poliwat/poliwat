      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cause I wrote about this youth paraphernalia in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- description here  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2202&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was my room soooo&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;time? In the room dad died, bonjo just texted me saying I can&amp;rsquo;t make music here I barely read her little drama paragraph -  mom just talked shit for over an hour on the phone to her and all she had resources for was sending a text. FYI I never read long drama texts, that&amp;rsquo;s why my smile crinkles are coming in full swing early like a big band. And the band plays on. I think I&amp;rsquo;m more angry than sad that I can&amp;rsquo;t do a serious recording session in the room my dad died, when he bought me a nice scarlet interface to record with from the hopsice bed when I was taking care of him, I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for it, he just surprise got it for me. And I found tears in my eyes at the beach today, meditating day two of sobriety feeling high as shit and the tears were more from the sunscreen why god every time I put sunscreen on my tears come? If I wanna cry about dad I&amp;rsquo;ll ask find the sunscreen. I&amp;rsquo;m too rushed right now to even eorry about it, no longer angry no longer sad, I&amp;rsquo;m miles, planets away from the fight with mom this morning, I&amp;rsquo;m out of this solar sytem, I&amp;rsquo;ve ran away with the van and the music equipment and played everywhere from madison to the sidewalks and I came back and bought the house and kicked out mom and put her in her new modest beach house and I turned the green room I painted I sit in now into a studio so I could record my best songs in the spot he died.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a hot minute between logs here. 1 week? 1 year? 1 life? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how long it&amp;rsquo;s been it&amp;rsquo;s happening again, as cycles educate. This time round run run and found nothing but self introspection factoring every poor sap in my presence holding back enough to not let on I&amp;rsquo;m socio, as if it&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing to be socio opinionated. Bring me someone with the attention span as I.</description>

|| &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo; arises, not in the dumb parts that make the sum, but in the complex patterns they organize themselves in ||
Kinda like the &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t completely exist until your &amp;lsquo;i&amp;rsquo; in every possible universe is in conversation
oh ye whose says I s no I s as anything to do with my body, I reckon.
Her sold soul swells hell high watermelon wheat on tap

      <description>@ LA museum where jack and I danced years ago
surprised he called it a treasured memory.
Me and Helcat ate at cantor&amp;rsquo;s and god damn I had the pastrami reuben and have been high ever since. Real
I like these swivel chairs more than that art on the walls
oh this will fuck us up
always talking enthusiastically about how something&amp;rsquo;s going to fuck me up, like this black Yerba Mate Tea, this lavender spray, this homemade kombucha.</description>

Didn’t get soaked till the end of the pier&amp;hellip; so dropped helcat off at grover beach train station, walked pismo and got to the end of the pier. I read the letter freewrite I wrote on the plane from chicago when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I was going to make it to my dad in time. Well I fucking made it and he made it one more month and I was there all the time and slept in the room and felt beyond horrid on the couch at myself for not giving him mouth to mouth in his last moments when he said he couldn&amp;rsquo;t breath, and I just fucking hate myself for it and the fine line between hating oneself and loving oneself someone tell me cause I walked pismo without a mind just lead by the theatre of my feet, my feet as a submarine after it rained there, me in all black 3 layers of cotton.</description>

I came here to help dad, I was hoping to stay a few weeks, maybe up to xmas to show support and for us to grieve together. It&#39;s too short a time to rent somewhere else in the area, and I need to be in the city to move my career forward.</description>

that was a month where dtme

 death was life and life was death and they were locked together in an eternal mad lmove battle and this was the final word and the meaning of the world and thence came a radiance that could glorify all misery and thence came a shadow that trumpeted all joy and beauty but from out of this darkness joy burned more intimately and more beautifully and love had a deeper glow within this night -from flute dreams by herman hesse (Strange news from a another star)  </description>

Had a great day of work for Aris
when I did the transfer from the blue line to the brown I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like quite going home yet. I walked around looking for a nice sounding ambient place to record brown dog. It was only 8 pm and only chains and nice restaurants were open. Nothing I liked. I somehow walked straight to the next CTA station, and yet again gave someone a smile and they asked for money, anyone you smile at in the city is looking for money so far.</description>

      <description>you are a wonderful person too complex a creature to be nailed down on any one person place or thing besides maybe you&#39;ve got the same curse as me patiently waiting for the freedom working towards the freedom of diner hopping going from diner to diner to diner to diner.  Cause when you get to one, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter it it&amp;rsquo;s a desert outside, a busy street, or snowing. Diners stay timeless.</description>

What idea is going to get me 3 meals and a cot, a place to record, a beach house for my mom? Everything else will go to pilot&amp;rsquo;s license and the nonprofit turned summer camps music camp orrphange. You know. Brining back the musician in everyone.</description>

      <description>github.center.wav by Michael Betts  Artist writeup:
The philosophy behind Github has been a big inspiration as a digital media artist
Each track is a git command line, the idea being an instrumental track you can hit play on whenever you need that command.
Tracks are all free and open source, and some of the STEMS(the ones that didn&amp;rsquo;t get lost on my broken laptop) are available here @archive</description>

when you hear so much of people dying
related it to the plasted and wax paper
related to the convenience of hot n ready food

if it all gives you cancer don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it
i cant cure your white lady
but i cn love you in a new way
everytime
and the plastic

BS was going down at 530 and my mom and sister went and I was silently not invited back and later my mom said it was good I didn&amp;rsquo;t go and that she thinks the devil got me and she laughed and I just want to kill myself cause although I told my sister last week satan&amp;rsquo;s most brilliant invention was the &amp;lsquo;word of God&amp;rsquo; - I still get spiritual guidance through bible study and the community is nice.</description>
