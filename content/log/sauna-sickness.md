making music is like navigating

you have countless pitfalls that are hard to avoid
but if you listen you can make something through all the noise in the world


*555 PM*

Put a good dent in the paperback copy of Brown Dog my dad gave me. Had a workout and sauna session at the Y but I feel sick. I'm not hungover. Made this in less than an hour

Jack made me mad but I can't help but more feel sorry for him. Based on old phone conversations, I constantly see why Becca couldn't live with him.

I'm here to help you jack, not be your emotional punching bag. I don't need to be here to finish Poliwat. I can live at my own home and do that.

you lied about clearing out a room for me upon moving in

you haven't lifted a finger helping your mom with the garage

you don't clean up after yourself

you work against me instead of with me

you are belittling

you don't encourage growth

I don't want to be in the middle of tensions

when you tell your mother she loves lexi more than you

All I have to do is reword that around my feelings and that's how you do it :)

-=-=-=--=-

#### who cares finishing poliwat is my only task

Working on teensy tutorials

its super cool!

You can do to a decimal number can also be done to a binary number.

The base of each number system is also called the radix. The radix of a decimal number is ten, and the radix of binary is two. The radix determines how many different symbols are required in order to flesh out a number system. In our decimal number system we’ve got 10 numeral representations for values between nothing and ten somethings: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each of those symbols represents a very specific, standardized value.

In binary we’re only allowed two symbols: 0 and 1. But using those two symbols we can create any number that a decimal system can.
