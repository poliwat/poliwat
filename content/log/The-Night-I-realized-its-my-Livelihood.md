**and life got a lot better**

it's **23:22**

but today

police yelled at becca helen gina and I outside a fancy liqour shop

and on the megaphone they said please step away from each other

social distancing

and that was the best

and I wish I could remember the rest

but it's one more day not well logged in full

realizing my weaknesses my strengths too
