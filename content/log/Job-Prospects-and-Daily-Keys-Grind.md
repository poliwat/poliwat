|| Got the keys iny my room thank you baby jesus H said I should've done it months ago ||



|| Spent a good part of yesterday morning getting Paleblue.fm back online, since it was on my resume. The recruiter Carolina did a last minute zoom interview with me yesterday - it looks like I got the job if I pass the background and reference checks. And I think I check out.

|| It would be a funny youtube video to walk up to a random police officer and ask them if they can look me up to know if there's any outstanding warrants or what my record looks like. I have no clue.   ||
