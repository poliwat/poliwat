I can rest a little easier tonight, got two job hookups from nick kush and also steven Rodriguez.

I can be a cabin manager at a camp for kids! I look forward to it for sure.

So I also need to schedule when I should leave for nipomo to sell chad my car. I want to do it before the play for sure, cause they I'll have a pretty penny and have all debts paid off when the celbrations happen.

In addition I need to build up a little budget.

Oh Nick's BFF is hooking it up with a job at Kianti's one of the more upper class restaurants downtown. That guy I can't remember his name but it starts with a D - and he has a sick deviant art, omg I wonder what it is. He works there. Anyways I just have to showup with my resume, tell the manager I know Mackenzie and bluff it up. I haven't met her yet but she sounds cool.

Being a camp counselor type person for kids sounds really fucking fun.

I'll be able to pay off this credit next week
