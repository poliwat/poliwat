### 2 POLIW.AT World my stage ((((((( work my stage ;)))))))

```

world my stage though I feel more a prop
clues I've learned from view in rearview mob
my tongue blunt tool tongue she likes on pop
world my stage though I feel more a prop

I yhink of life like a book
that my hook
I writing it casear said world your stage
its up to you what roll you play
highlights high life my life it romantic
razor sharp focus every rose I notice
my religion more women in power
I think mamma love a super power
Imma a sucka though  
Imma a suck for hyrule herb, red alert,
quick jab, bad meme, cute cat,
girl that makes art with her hands yeah
like ma ma ma ma ma who write
20 post it notes a day
alcoholic I saw the pattern then I trained
my mental screaming I'd walk the plank
walk the plank for my dreams
type fuck
bare feet on the coffee table
high life no coasters for dads coronas
lows worth the highs highs come in 50 flavors I
50 shades of mic
50 shades of mic ?
50 shades of pride !
50 shades of couldn't curb my taste for a glock 9!
50 shades of why !!!

world my stage though I feel more a prop
clues I've learned from view in rearview mob
my tongue blunt tool tongue she likes on pop
world mystage though I feel more a prop
ssssss  


```


like a pool make you see colors infinity spliff

too much call of duty I
