**Wed 923 AM**

Colors

Listening to damn my NEW VOCAL PEDAL, putting it on my vest.

The bus driver just let me go to the bathroom, but it was locked and so I sprinted to a field and got to jump over a huge bench.

My alarm didn't go off, I fucked up! I wanted to leave Sean the cassette

I have to be more blunt with my time with people.

Fingers crossed. I hope the Amtrak is late today. It's always late so I should hopefully make it. Otherwise I'm not sure what I'll do. I would go to a coffee shop and shootout rideshare messages


Damn I love it so much I should just work . Alright alright I majorly fucked up. Today officially I'm getting all my url's in the best state possible.


### Shoutout to peter you fucking taught me a lot, and I'm reaping the benefits right now !!!! METEORIC RISE
