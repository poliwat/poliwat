**1939**

```
(Verse 1)
G C D
Walking down central park
and oh it's mighty dark
please don't hurt me bum
you can have all my money
just don't take any of my
precious pride and gum
cause I got a date tonight
oh with one hell of a site
best I've done in a while I care to admit
with a pretty face and even better smile

(Chorus)
G F C
The last thing I need is a black eye
doesn't even matter how hard you try
doctors and lawyers still don't know why
isn't it funny we still die
we still die

(Verse 2)
G C D
I'm ex military too
I lied and said
told that bum with a karate kick too the head
then a sideways judo chop on his knee
Can't fight just what I saw from MTV

(Chorus)
G F C
The last thing I need is a black eye
doesn't even matter how hard you try
doctors and lawyers still don't know why
isn't it funny we still die
we still die

(Verse 3)
G C D
Well that's the story enough' said
Now it's time to tuck you in bed
Time to sleep this songs done
and that's the story
of how I met your mum

(Chorus)
G F C
The last thing I need is a black eye
doesn't even matter how hard you try
doctors and lawyers still don't know why
isn't it funny we still die
we still die
```
