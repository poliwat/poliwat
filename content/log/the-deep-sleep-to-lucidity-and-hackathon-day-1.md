2 things

making spagetti

sober


I slept from midnight, woke up for an hour like a good dad and made some breakt fast for myself and Erin, and helped Kenzie and Erin


Kenzie and Erin were leaving for LiB so I helped them a bit, then took a hot shower and feel hard back asleep. Even a cup of coffee couldn't wake me.

I needed to process everything that happened yesterday,
it was the first micro in a while. Now it's all about action. Like it always was.

Officially Max and I are the only ones in this house for the next 5-6 days! So Gwen and he sweetie never grabbed the carport, and it's going to rain tomorrow, so I'm going to bring the makerspace vibe up into the living room.

Also I double booked, Celia and Rebecca to sing on my grasshopper track tonight. I'm kicking myself cause Celia leaves in a freaking week, I should've hungout with her more and done wwwaaaay more recording than one freaking session.

Celia leaves in a week so I really wanna focus on her cause I have this note sheet where she is in like 4 tracks on the poliw.at album. Which is coming out June 17th


june 16th is tupak's birthday - perfect for the poliw.at debut


I helped Kenzie and Erin with some final packing
