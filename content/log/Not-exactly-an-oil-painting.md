Asia is art of many stories of troubled men.

I remake mid century furniture

with pallets and reclaimed wood a lot of the time

and just fannciful fancies

and if you're lucky you'll do it all in a month and move out by October :D

and hopefully save enough to at least get to georgia / virginia / etc
