#### Lyrics

```
(Verse 1)
constantly zoning out (6)
minds tenant to the clouds (6)
enough to make dad proud (6)
mamma made me loud (6)

you're a waitress waiting
I'm a failure taking my time
time the ultimate currency
nothing has value without time

(Bridge)
then why are you spending most of it
in company we don't like?

deep down in my heart
I have a tiny heart
on again off
otra vez march

I love you
but you don't know what you're talking about
I love you
but you don't know what you're talking about

I love you
but you don't know what you're talking about

(Bridge)
then why are you spending most of it
in company we don't like?
```


Not below this line (old version)

```

planning for tomorrow
is how you spend your time off

you're a waitress waiting

```
