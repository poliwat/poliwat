#### Lyrics

```
97 floors of jobs
no window in my sisters office
I had a job but I lost it

mom saw an ad
said would'nt it be nice
if my son drove me in his car
to his house
to his wife


and his kid
serve me up a coffee
wouldn't that be nice
but all I got is this song

dad works full time
no paycheck in a month
keeps giving me razors
for job interviews
I keep losing

my brother is a teacher
I'm wearing his shoes
says the moon landing's fake
his students say Earth is flat

the buildings have antenae's
how has no one noticed
they don't want me with my acid eyes

told food stamps lady
if I had a 9 to 5 I'd die
owe my girflriend 1000 dollars
but wrote her five songs
haven't recorded any of them
what's a girl to do?
life is short art is long  

I got six jobs I get high
if jobs were songs
(don't get me wrong)

job, ? what else am I going to do
I'm going to go to work
what else am I going to do?

(chorus)
we are jobs
what do you do
and by the way
let me do mine

```
