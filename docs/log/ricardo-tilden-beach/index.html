  <p><pre><code>I got my landboat
</code></pre>

<p><strong>12:21 pm</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to get ome uglies out - couldn&rsquo;t sleep couldn&rsquo;t do anything watched a smart TV lost phone on the beach with H yesterday blamed her cause she didn&rsquo;t let me go back cause she was hungry</p>

<p>we got to the car and I realized I didn&rsquo;t have my phone</p>

<p>we had an hour and 15 until they closed the parking lot</p>

<p>It was 2 miles away max</p>

<p>instead she had me drive all around through traffic to a new place slightly closer</p>

<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t park there so she had to stay at the van</p>

<p>and then I ran and couldn&rsquo;t even find the spot we were at from the new location</p>

<p>and she wouldn&rsquo;t acknowledge that was a bad idea</p>

<p>when I said it was a bad idea out the gate</p>

<p>I said we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to park there</p>

<p>I said it would be harder to find the spot we were at coming from an unknown location</p>

<p>and I regret listening to her</p>

<p>and I&rsquo;m chemically angry coming down from cigs</p>

<p>and Jessie&rsquo;s in town one more day</p>

<p>and they&rsquo;re all doing a ladies lunch soon</p>

<p><strong>2008</strong></p>

Heaven is here on Earth

until we swayed away from it.
