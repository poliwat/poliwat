is this water this is ice
this me on the mic
not afraid to be poor
show you the ropes show you the door
genocide patents, not people
oversell trash not sheeple
Imma fly
dad just died
is this water is this ice
my chest screams
travel write tunes I
Imma flyy
dad just died
is this aqua
you that pressure
Imma miss ya
way I feel
we not ended
But I'll end it
I'm over
how I feel
I done said it
I sorry I meant it
cringe time
that my last cringe line
ride that pony time
Luv it I like
You inside
and out
compassion and love for your
connected between seeming unconnected things
