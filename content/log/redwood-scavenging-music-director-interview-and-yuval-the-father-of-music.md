**monday 957 AM**

Update sitting at a park



**Monday 12:13 PM**

Find myself on the 17 again.
No headphones today because I want to just hear everything. I went overboard on music the past week, and one of the mushroom nights I went down the rabbit hole imagining that I disrecpected music for too long, and now am paying the price for it. It's all made up. Super cute girl walking by outside. So many cute girls here.  




<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_(given_name)">Yuval from sweetwater is my new GO TO guy for music equipment. This dude is the shit!!!!

I want to sell everything I own, then do a heroic dose in the woods and pass out on top of some water tanks less than a mile from my house. Then when I wake up it will be like resetting. Like starting a video game. I want to do this like every three months lol.

Also I haven't had a chance to do a real good log in a while but today is the day. The real question though - soundcloud? Do I go pro? It looks like I have to... it's just so expensive. I'm going to abuse this vocal pedal, and start busking lowkey downtown a little bit.

Scatter city

had the second job interview for that music director job at that boys and girls club. Met Jennifer and she's super cool! Fingers crossed that I get the job <3


Heading to palo alto - going to meeetup with Avery and we're meeting this Stanford Professor that may be the first real Omari client. Well real as in it's weekly work. Which would be nice, because it would be all about producing a podcast.

But priority 1 is to get a mountain bike, and a scoot.

Official release date of the paleblue.fm project will be to officially become a nonprofit

I need to empty my phone / get a better phone and work it more.

I need to get business cards going for avery and I.

Ahahaa I need to prep for the radio show tonight.

It looks like I won't be able to

Reminder, routine, reward....
