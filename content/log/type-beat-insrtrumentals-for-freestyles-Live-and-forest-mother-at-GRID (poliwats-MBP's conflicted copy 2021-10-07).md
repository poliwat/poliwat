Alright Kenzie! I do need to borrow to give Scott rent money, I sent out the invoice to Tom

Kenzie!! Can you help me by letting me borrow money to pay Scott?
I will pay you back! And would like to help with the wx press stuff

I sent an invoice out yesterday and am expecting that in the next few days

I'm at Stanford for one more night cause Avery and I are doing this GRID thing put on by Art x

Will prolly drive back tonight with Avery's car! He's letting me borrow it and I'll go go all out on making muns  

If you had $905 I could at least make some min payments on this credit card too

But any amount you can safely do would be a huge help! <3

And can setup to pay back this
