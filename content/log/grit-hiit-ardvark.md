@ Sean's w/Chad

T Ferr questions from tools of titans. He's a smooze but these questions are decent.

1. What is the book (or books) you've given most as a gift, and why? Or what re one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?
2. What purchase of $100 or has most positively changed your life?
3. How has a failure, or apparent failures, set you up for later success? Do you have a 'favorite failure' of yours?
4. If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it - metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to milllions or billions - what would it say and why?
5. What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you've ever made ( money, time, energy)
6. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?
7. In the last 5 years, what new belief, behavior, or habit most improved your life?
8. What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to go into the 'real world'? What advice should they ignore?
9. What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?
10. In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to, (distractions, invitations, etc?) What new realizations and / or approaches helped? Any other tips?
11. When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost focus temporarily, what do you do? (ie what ?s do you ask yourself)?
