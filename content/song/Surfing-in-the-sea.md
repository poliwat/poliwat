D C D ( capo 0 or 2(depending on health) )

(Verse 1)
I was just surfing in the sea
hoping you were wathing me
on a bright summers day
day day gay gay gay
gay gay gay
gay gay gay day

(Chorus 1)
and a shark came swimming
right outa the oceans floor
and she said that looks like
a big juicy wet seal to me
uh oh

(Verse 2)
well I was dead right there
I forgot my shark repellant spray
though I struggle with my belief in god
I began to pray pray pray
pray pray pray
pray pray pray
pray pray pray


(Chorus 2)
The shark came swimming
and made an awesome roar

made an awesome roar
I swear I never heard anything
like it before
and it went like This

(meow solo vocals GLHF)

my reprise(mine)
but it was you who saved me
though I still long to break free

I asked you how you made that shark go
you replied you did not know
your zodiac is an aquarius
and you just go with the flow
flow flow flow
blow blow blow
blow blow blow
blow blow blow
blow blow blow flow

(verse 3)
so I went and gave you a big wet kiss
but bad breath came on mighty fast I swear I nearly drowned

(chorus 3)
but I said screw it you're my love
so I gave you the biggest wettest kiss around

(bridge 3)
cause it was you who saved me
although I still long to break free

```
