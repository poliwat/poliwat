The Internet will not be homogenized
[chorus]
The Internet will not be homogenized x3
[verse1]
the internet will not be brought to you by facebook
targeted ads algorithms that deliver you goods via drone strike
Internet service providers will not be the gatekeepers
ISPs will not throttle thoughts
ISPs will not data discriminate
poor people will have the same internet as the rich
the internet is a human right
that’s the 31st amendment on the bill of rights
we just haven’t wrote it yet
let’s put that generation in charge

[chorus]
The Internet will not be homogenized x4

[verse2]
for those of you that don’t know
buzz feed that the modern day simple speak
1984 sold out since trump got prophecy

but if you gotta pay extra for the cheese then

the internet’s sites will not be bundled and throttled as a pay-per-package system
the internet will remain in control of the people
and the power of the people will choose
tim berner’s lee will not die to a 404’d noose

[drum break]
article 31 of the bill of rights will state the free and open internet is a human right
[verse 3]
pay monthly access pay by packages and
the internet will not be bottlenecked bullied beaten by ISP's and controlled for profit
the internet will not be the next tv
the internet will not be bad for the soul
the internet will not be bad for my mamas soul
5 50 and 15 year olds regardless of income will be able to access all sites lord willing
the internet brings the poorest with more information than the raegan administration
the internet will not go down to corporations

the internet brings the first real equalizer in thousands of years since first clubs were used

the internet will be free and open
a human right like the ocean
the internet will not suffer because suffering folks are in charge of the white house
the internet will never be a complete safe space, brave space rat race
the internet will not be a rat race
the internet will remain in the power of the people and the people in the power of the internet will choose
tim berner’s lee will not die to a 404’d noose
the internet will not be brought to you as pay-per-access site,
cnn bloggers will always be assholes
don’t mean to dot com burst your bubble but the internet will remain open, 24/7, except when the servers crash from DDos attacks
but that’s old school news now that
software will be pirated and used for creative means until they make money
then they will buy the software
[verse 4]
dearfcc.org
the internet will not be homogenized
the internet will not be privatized
the internet will not be categorized by tier pay-per-package bundles
steam and google and youtube will always be the same price
Dear FCC, the internet is not a TV
digital democracy isn’t easy
neither was my ex but the one thing even we could agree on was
total Net Neutrality

[chorus]
the internet will not be homogenized x4
[verse 5]
discrimination already prevalent in this nation
in these times is not going to hit data
data discrimination human rights violation
ISPs will be regulated and treated like people
like they said they wanted
therefore people Die and so ISP’s need a shelf life of say 80 years
like people
then they will be dismantled distributed out
the internet will not be the next TV
tool of the elite to control how we think we need to buy
the internet will not divide us
the internet will unite us

-==-=-NOT BELOW THIS LINE=--=-=-=-=-==-=-==-=-=-
you don’t pay extra to use the carpool lane

ISP’s will not be gatekeepers
secretaries will be our gatekeepers
net neutrality is non-negotiable
all internet traffic will remain equal
you don’t pay extra to use the carpool lane
freeways don’t cost extra if you want to use a certain lane
alexa and siri always listening
the internet will not bring you to your knees
we will not pay more for the cheese
we will not pay more for the sleeze
internet not an assembly line
1955 unionize the people
the internet will not be sleazy for ron weasley
before you think you want it yet
dan harmon’s podcast will not cost extra
we will not care when the next rick and morty ep comes out if it costs an extra 40 bucks a month to access adult swim
