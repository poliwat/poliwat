      <description>do you lose respect for me if I bate right now or gain respect
so I dont bug you
cause its been an hour since we had sex
and I can&amp;rsquo;t hold it
that&amp;rsquo;s why I don&amp;rsquo;t go out by myself
 cause now hours later we&#39;re getting back to our roots just biked to you and we&#39;re starting our night at Volumes Books in Wicker Park I brought us a bottle of Cali Roots and plastic cups we&#39;ll open the bottle with this pen and I&#39;ll get back to writing about my hate of plastic but the plastic in me loves plastic!</description>

      <description>you are a wonderful person too complex a creature to be nailed down on any one person place or thing besides maybe you&#39;ve got the same curse as me patiently waiting for the freedom working towards the freedom of diner hopping going from diner to diner to diner to diner.  Cause when you get to one, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter it it&amp;rsquo;s a desert outside, a busy street, or snowing. Diners stay timeless.</description>

      <description>the inky only helps my psyche. I&amp;rsquo;m jogging this much I feel. Lovae as capital. Hypothetical house. Pable blue dot fm. Life the musical. Federal beat reserve. What idea is going to get me 3 meals and a cot, a place to record, a beach house for my mom? Everything else will go to pilot&amp;rsquo;s license and the nonprofit turned summer camps music camp orrphange. You know. Brining back the musician in everyone.</description>
