```
is this the right thing to do?
to be honest without resentment?
is it right of you?
to bring your war to our shore?
how the end justifies the means
is this a mental impairment?
a mental disability?

should I forgive and forget
I do and I will
forgive and forget
forget to follow your dreams
your uniform job
makes you lonessome and a tease

phobia industry
make money off
promoting bigrot elegantly
nicely

```

**940AM**

Today your eyes have opened. You no longer wait for her to wake up.
You live your own life. Like a weed inbetween concrete,
you don't wait for permission to grow. The following is your new doctrine.
The promotion of Forgiveness, love and legacy, and the ultimate secret goal that few seldom understand in total.
To promote advantages gained from daily actions, daily rites, and hopeful rituals.
To challenge and question. To have an engrained sequence when the mind has been boarded.
To do the correct actions when the mind has been commadered
To master situational ammunition while in the trenches, part of your hippy BUDS training.

Can you keep it together? Can you keep your eyes on the prize?
Or do you question everything - like how can you defeat something that
can read your mind? Speak every language? How can you defeat an entity
that knows more about yourself then you? You train in quantum actions.
You train in training. You safegaurd those you love, and keep them safe.

There's a hole in my soul. It's a very deep hole. I can feel this hole today. The ambition is gone. The hate is gone. There isn't a person to get what I want from, there isn't a person on this Earth that can help me with this. I must train to learn how to learn how to listen yet again, and somewhere down the road - after many undistinguished and simple actions can I even begin to solve this problem of soul.

Where does the soul go when it is destroyed? The void cuts deep, but it feels precise. Like a surgerical cut through the use of a dim blue light, in a cylindrical shape. It cleanly deleted everything in its path, and disapeared.

There is no darkness without light. There is no light without dark. There is a better life outside this yin and yang, and I'm going to catalyze it.

There you go, there you are. Back to therapy
So I dare ask, who is your person?
Who is your strategy? Who is your bug out bag? Who do you want to be? Who do you want to see? Who is your father? Who was your father? Why do you avoid the need to bleed? Why do you prefer to bleed?

Lord help me, for the sole reason that I don't ask for help. I'm not asking for help, because I only rejoice in your Grace Lord. When times are hard I thank you. But leaving semantics now, I say the three words which is all I can plead in my head - Lord help me. Choosing peace and growth over these demons is paramount right now. Hitler was penniless at 30, Eintein was working in a post office. It's still not too late to completely overhaul my life, and I've seen it. I've seen what we can do together Lord. I've seen firsthand the posititive impact you have empowered me to give. And I plant to fullfil your vision, and stay true to my promise. I may have faltered beyond recognition, even beyond my own self, but I am not giving up Lord.
