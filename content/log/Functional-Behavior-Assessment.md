**Wednesday 119 PM**

I can't even look at myself right now.

I don't deserve to read.

I slept through the calendar call for talking with Olliver.

After all this time.

So I could focus on what's not working. Everything seems to have fallen through. But that's not true and is only my perception.

I'm so broken I just slept 11 hours.

How am I not to think that I'm pissing this day away.

The sun is beating down dtrongly outside. I could've gone to the beach the past two days.

But I'm a slave to my ideals.

I don't get it I can't even function anymore. So I'm going to have to go even deeper, and get through this.

In this FBA, I'm not doing well.

**wed 203 PM**

I'm so disjointed. but better now.


I'm not sure what I'm really doing wrong.
Well I know hwat I'm doing wrong but don't seem to have the proper tempermant.


People love me. Whenever I move somewhere new, everyone falls IN LOVE with me and my work.
But I prefer 1 on 1 relations, versus group dynamics. But blending well with a group is a daily requirence of my work.

And what is my work? Right now it's getting a god damn map on the site.

"""Nicholas Mevoli, a charming, handsome youngster from Florida who died in 2013 at Dean’s Blue Hole in the Bahamas wrote in a blog post:

Emotions can be a great detriment to the freediver. Water is acceptance of the unknown, of demons, of emotions, of letting go and allowing yourself to flow freely with it. Never lie to the water because you are lying to yourself.""

    Songs masterlist: (dif each time) songs are living entities, extensions of my self, that I get to evovle and interact with. Which is how we should look at these songs in a larger sense.

talking about them doesn't put you in their revered throne

what is your goal

to be long lasting

or to be long lasting on what time scale
