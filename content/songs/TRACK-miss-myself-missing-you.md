Most likely my saddest song. Took a long time to sing these words.

[once]
```
Iâ€™m not usually the one to slow it down
but that saddest truth that gets to you
and I know that my laptop is missing screw you
and I missing myself oh missing you

but what's dat hardest truth
of myself missing you

like everything ends
or having loose screw

what's the hardest truth
when there is no truth

I'll never be all I see
but


[Last Past]

Life's so precious
No one whats they doing
world full of suffering
but that those soft truths
what the hardest truth?
everything ends eventually for us all
I miss my self missing you

```
