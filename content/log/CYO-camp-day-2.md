OMG the racoon eating woman !!!


That's a family member of mine, like great aunt. She's Jeannette, like 87 years old. She packed her walker in the back of a rav 4 and drove my dad and other family on a 7 mile dirt path in Michigan to a private cabin on a lake.

With a bud light in the coaster! She's just the most metal woman I know.
