PBD - relaxation night:

intro
    - national poetry month announcement
    - everything you hear, was recorded since our conversation.
    - because I need to earn it if I'm going to meet Nikki Silva.




I didn't want to tell you

But I have a music invention thing I really want to finish and release as an open source project.

And I spent the last 6 months producing and acting in an original play written by one of my best friends. We performed it for two nights in the bay.

=--==--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==--= =--==--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==--= =--==--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==--=

So tonight, we have a very special episode for you.

Tonight's episode is dedicated to Sean,

I scooted up to you on bicycle day.

I think a 3 point strategy,

breathing,

calming the intellectual mind,

and know your beat,

is how I would want to relax.

Oh and everything you hear tonight, has been recorded after our conversation last Thursday.

I'm saying all this audio is FRESH OFF THE PRESSSSSSSSSS

Well except for 2 things, can you guess what those are?

Oh and just a heads up, it's 'national poetry month' too just incase you didn't know.

You're in the passenger seat with Michael Betts and Niko Kush.

=--==--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==--= =--==--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==--= =--==--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==--=



**Monday 438 PM**

Poem to Sean:

{ blow into harmonica }

Update: Niko and I are at the top of a tree.

I would like to end this episode of pale blue dot,

by telling you what I do to relax.

I climb trees

  - Here with a special poem I wrote for you Sean.


Do you have a piano I can sample?  


In the spirit of national poetry month, I wrote you a poem sean

  It's called kid wizard and the little woke that could:

  I

  I

  the most relaxing part of being here

  in the tree

  you get adrenaline at first

  this is a poem

  the world is my stage, though I feel more a prop


this project was made to show you

what is in your backyard

the people in your forests,

the music around you,

and what I can do with a little help from friends

I'm addicted and I hate to admit and as undeserving as I am

I need you Sean

I need your help

I need your help now

I am tired

I'm a data junky, but hate mansplaining

I like to assume that people are smart

That's why I like to record other people, because they have really valuable data and experiences that I can't have.

I am tired of debt

I am tired of not knowing how to pay for tomorrow

I need a mentor

I need a guru

so sean, grasshopper my grasshopper

I speak to you in total confidence incompetent

pool go go girl went postal in my post office  


I ask for you help

in making me pay rent with media.

-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=- -=-=-=-=-==-=-=-==-=-

There are few times that I ask for help

My tongue a blunt tool,

=--=-= =--=-= =--=-= =--=-= =--=-==--=-= =--=-=

and before I LEAVE:

  - order train ticket
  - clean room

I spent the last six months producing and acting in an original play. You know the video game the Sims?


It was called the Sims's Sim's and is a comedy dealing with whether or not we are in a simulation.   

If you'd like to see the other projects I'm working on,

A game of show and tell

You tell me  

and I'll show you

Let me show you
Can I show you the state of my music invention?

I need a mentor

Well a mentor as in I need 2 meals and a cot for three months and I think I can finish a road worthy version. I have most of the pieces, all I need is time.


Please help me earn my rent though media work. Please support pale blue dot.

I think the most valuable parts of society are in the cracks.

I am dedicated to doing that

Finding the most profound in early day life, with every community I can.

I am religiously

Studies show that community, and people are the strongest ties. This tape at times can serve as evidence for me

I showed you a little more candid version of what your students actually talk about outside of academia

You confirmed in me that even the highest
