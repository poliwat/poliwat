Suffer now,


Here are a few quotes which have had the biggest impact on me.

Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. - Bruce Lee
Don’t quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion. - Muhammad Ali
Your dream has to be bigger than your fear. - Steve Harvey
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. - Steve Jobs
The mind is everything. What you think you become. - Buddha
If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things. - Albert Einstein
The only impossible journey is the one you never begin. - Anthony Robbins
The first to apologize is the bravest. The first to forgive is the strongest. The first to forget is the happiest. - Unknown
When it hurts – observe. Life is trying to teach you something. - Unknown

my buddies undies
and I ruined Niko’s pants!

I ruin everything
remix anything
listen the master class for controlling microexpressions
always intuitive to me

signed the treaty
heart breaking
love making
song of a gun
Killed my past
so I’ll slay my future
that’s the way of the gun
