<pre><code>To god
To our creators
To our endeavors
To our dreams!
Who are we what are we
In relation too .oo too
You !
Not one of these OH who am I in relation to you talks
If you don't know now you'l never know accurately
It hurts doesn't it, letting words hurt
Words never hurt they never did
It's you that thought they did
Words never hurt
And the more words you construct
The less you get from the true true
And baby
Aaadas
He sufferes now, and 900 billion future humans will be born with access to his brain
Is that not worth it
Would he go against that?
We both read his thoughts at 20. He was completely developed, not a single instution can hold him. This is his only destiny

Yeah it might seem that way
But this feeling I have... do you not have it?
Like we treat him like a lab rat then justify it with imaginary people of the future that don't exist yet. And  while we're all human we're all susepctible to treating
WHY DO WE HUMANS TREAT OTHER HUMANS LIKE ANIMALS? LIKE POLIWAT FOR INSTANCE. WE TREAT THEM LIKE A LAB RAT IN ORDER TO BUILD THE LIBRARY OF RESEARCH UP TO THE POINT THAT ALL SEXPERIERNCES HAVE BEEN HAD AND CAN BE SHARED UPON DELIVERY
WE TREAT THOSE LESS RESILIENT TO BE PIGS
LIKE IF YOU AREN'T RESILIENT IN THE FIRST PLACE
THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU IN SCIENCE IS THE CONTROL GROUP FOR NON RESILIENT PEOPLE
THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S A CHOCE
THAT HAVE TO CUT OUT THE NOISE WE MAKE
AND IF THEY CAN DO THAT THEYRE WORTHY
YEAH I WAS TAUGHT THAT TOO AT THE ACADEMY
WRITING FOR JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME SAVED ME IN THE PAST
WHEN I HAD CONTROL
NOW WRITING IS ALL I CAN THINK IN
WRITING FOR TOO LONG KILLE DME
THREE MONTHS PASS
SCIENCE LECUTRES FOR JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME SAVED ME IN THE PAST
NOW SCIENCE LECTURES KILL ME
MUSIC WAS ALL I COULD THINK OF
MUSIC WAS ALL I COULD SEE, FEEL, TOUCH, AND SENSE
TWO HOT RED HEADS IN A YELLOW VW GIVE ME A LOOK AND I DON'T TALK TO THEM LOL OOPS FUTURE MICHAEL I HATE YOU IT LOOKS LIKE
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ... NOTHING !
BREAK IT OFF AND MAKE MUSIC
NO ONE IS REAL
UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE
THATS A SUM
OF MY ABUSES OF MUSIC
I SEEK THERAPY
I'LL GO TO ASHLEY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
BUT I GOT A SCREENPLAY
SOMEONE HELP ME
GOD HELP ME
I WENT TO THE OTHER SIDE
TO THE POINT
THE OTHER SIDE IS ALL I KNOW
AND I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE MY BELIEFS
FUCK BANKS FUCK MONEY SATAN WROTE THE BIBLE
THAT'S JUST TIP OF THE PEAK
100 MORE UNPOPULAR BELIEFS
CAUSE I FREE THINK
LOOK AROUND
TALK TO MANY
AND RECORD
THEN LISTEN BACK
THE RHTETORICS OCCUR IN PATTERNS
ITS SO RARE
TO FIND SOMEONE THAT FREELY SPEAKS
THEREFORE ITS SO RARE TO FINID SOMEONE THAT FREELY  
THIKNKS
CAUSE YOU CAN ONLY TELL IN ACTIONS
AND THESE ACTIIONS OF ADDICTION WILL BE THE BEST OF ME
TAKE THE BEST OF ME
LIKE BETTS ALWAS DID
I FEEL IT SLIPPING
AM I LIKE MY FATHER
FATHERS FATHER AND FATHERS FATHER FATHER
I THINK NOT
CAUSE DARWIN WAS GOOD TO ME
AND THOUGH I LIED
MOM SORRY NEVER MADE IT TO THE DMV
YOU CAR 3 TALLBOYS AT THE BEACH
JUST ME
LOVE SORRY TOLD YOU
I WOULD GET A BANK ACCOUNT
THAT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT
TO ME
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
NONE OF THAT FEELS RIGHT
DOESN'T MATTER IF I'M SOBER
DOESN'T MATTER IF I'M FUCKED UP
THAT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT TO ME
SO AFTER TODAY
GOD PLEASE LET ME SOBER UP
AND SURE RETHINK EVERYTHING
GIVE IT MORE THAN A MOMENT AND HOLD SPACE
THEN KNOW
MY UNPOPULAR BELIEFS
WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME
UNLESS I COMMUNICATE THEM EFFECTIVELY
AND WHNE I DO THAT SUCCESFULLY
I WON'T NEED TO DRINKY
SMOKEY TOKEY COKEY AND LUCY
CAUSE MY EACH STEP
WOULD BE
A WALKING SYMPHONY
AND THAT'S THE PATH I'M ON
LET ME GO BACK TO SCHOOL
I SWEAR ON MY SOUL
YOU KNOW THIS
LET ME JUST RUN BACK TO SCHOOL
AND THAT'LL HELP ME FOCUS
THIS TIME AROUND I SWEAR
I'M GOING TO WORK MENIAL JOBS
IN ORDER TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL
THEN I'M GOING TO GET A GOOD DEGREE
BUT DIDN'T DO IT FOR THE DEGREE
I DID IT AUSE JAIL DOESN'T HAVE A LASER CUTTER
AND I JUST NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH 3 MEALS AND A COT
AND MY LOVE MIGHT SAVE ME
AND HOPEFULLY WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE TO OUR RELATIONSHIP
IM ALMOST FUCKED UP ENOUGH TO GO TALK TO THOSE GINGER BITCHES
BUT THAT'S NOT ME
I CAN'T SEE
OMG MAYBE I SHOULD
MAYBE I SHOULDNT I SHOULD DEF GET OUT OF MY HEAD MAYBE I SHOULD PROVE IT I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE BUT I CAN SEE
I NEED SOME HELP
NEED HELP
NEED HELP
HELP THAT BEYOND ME
HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP
I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP

YOU KNOW WHAT?
IM THROWING OUT ALL MY WORK
I'M TRASHING ALL MY IDEAS
BECAUSE YOU CAN TALK OH YOU CAN TALK
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
I SPENT THE LAST 2-3 YEARS
CREATING EVERY DAY AND BARELY RELEASING
THE BALANCE WAS OUT
IT WASN'T ONE SIDED
AND NOW
AND NOW
I DON'Y CARE ANYMORE
STARTING TOMORROW

SCENE 2 - INT - HOP 1 AND BLINDING LIGHT WITH FEMANONS AND RADIATION MIC 1
MUSIC CUE: “I am soup” by POLIW.AT
FEMANON 1
Did it work?
FEMANON 2
His voice will be wiped, he won’t have any recollection of what he’s done. Just temperament and personality will remain in tact.
Last year was the control group, how behavior is altered.
If he starts to do what he did last time, symptoms of mental illness will occur and
FEMANON 1
if he becomes aware of himself?
FEMANON 2
We’ll know instantly when he does, we’ll get a push notification. What is it?
FEMANON 1
We&rsquo;ve never put someone in a  remote viewing session for this long.
FEMANON 2
You know game theory. That methodology tells us it&rsquo;s the best course of action in this state. We&rsquo;re trying to fill in the pieces that weren&rsquo;t done yet. Remember? Feed the machine and the machine feeds you
FEMANON 1
It doesn&rsquo;t feel right
Femanon 2
It doesn&rsquo;t feel right by design. Progress might not feel right in the moment, yet feels right long after we&rsquo;re through with the space.
FEMANON 1
I know I learned that but it just doesn&rsquo;t feel right this time
FEMANON 2
What&rsquo;s a factor that might be causing that?
FEMANON 1
I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; his vitals are doing unreasonably well. His thoughts are his own despite our noise. You&rsquo;re here you know how rare this is. For someone under such distress to be thinking so clearly
FEMANON 2
His concious thought trains are transcoded and encypted. That&rsquo;s common among these types. He found out we could read his mind in the 3rd sequence, so that realization of self awareness changed how his linguistic conscious stream of thoughts are.
FEAMANON 1
But we can&rsquo;t see what he&rsquo;s doing outside
The images of his mind are in the feed. He&rsquo;s been doing this for years in order to block out. Somehow he&rsquo;s abstracted away all thoughts into some sort of system only known to him. It&rsquo;s a wonder he&rsquo;s functional at all, you only see this type of brain in severe schizophrenics to the point where a lobotomy is needed. What could it be?
RADIATION MIC
IT’S THE RADIATION BITCHES
(Poliw.at screams from the corner of the room.The cancer in me gained consciousness and infected them! I can see them but they can’t hear me, but I love haunting them while in this state, and they have no known defenses against me. Perfect!)
SCENE 3 - EXT - SKIP 1 AND BEACH WITH DARLENE, POLIW.AT AND FREDDY 1
MUSIC CUE: “Pale Blue Intros” by POLIW.AT
(Poliwat asleep along shore, just vest and shoulders and dirt.)</p>

<p>DARLENE
Hey wake up!
poliw.at……

when you wake up…
when you finally wake up
(Silence. poliw.at wakes up in the middle of a field (later on end the set and the day with poliw.at passing out)
(he turns the knob on the vest and up starts a radio station.
FREDDY MEHRABIAN
how do you orient?
how do you orient every single time you wake up?
how can you consistently check as to if you woke up?
we’re coming to the halfway point of our sonic journey
or real accounts of how humans make heads or tails of anything,
chip for chap, ruby or rupee,
everything, and every day.
Success. After you’ve now unlearned everything
how do you orient?
I’m your host, Freddy Mehrabian
It is Monday, 1st of the month, 4:37 PM

TWO HOT RED HEADS IN A YELLOW VW GIVE ME A LOOK AND I DON&rsquo;T TALK TO THEM LOL OOPS FUTURE MICHAEL I HATE YOU IT LOOKS LIKE
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED &hellip; NOTHING !
BREAK IT OFF AND MAKE MUSIC
NO ONE IS REAL
UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE
THATS A SUM
OF MY ABUSES OF MUSIC
I SEEK THERAPY
I&rsquo;LL GO TO ASHLEY
I DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHAT I&rsquo;M DOING
BUT I GOT A SCREENPLAY
SOMEONE HELP ME
GOD HELP ME
I WENT TO THE OTHER SIDE
TO THE POINT
THE OTHER SIDE IS ALL I KNOW
AND I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO CHANGE MY BELIEFS
FUCK BANKS FUCK MONEY SATAN WROTE THE BIBLE
THAT&rsquo;S JUST TIP OF THE PEAK
100 MORE UNPOPULAR BELIEFS
CAUSE I FREE THINK
LOOK AROUND
TALK TO MANY
AND RECORD
THEN LISTEN BACK
THE RHTETORICS OCCUR IN PATTERNS
ITS SO RARE
TO FIND SOMEONE THAT FREELY SPEAKS
THEREFORE ITS SO RARE TO FINID SOMEONE THAT FREELY<br />
THIKNKS
CAUSE YOU CAN ONLY TELL IN ACTIONS
AND THESE ACTIIONS OF ADDICTION WILL BE THE BEST OF ME
TAKE THE BEST OF ME
LIKE BETTS ALWAS DID
I FEEL IT SLIPPING
AM I LIKE MY FATHER
FATHERS FATHER AND FATHERS FATHER FATHER
I THINK NOT
CAUSE DARWIN WAS GOOD TO ME
AND THOUGH I LIED
MOM SORRY NEVER MADE IT TO THE DMV
YOU CAR 3 TALLBOYS AT THE BEACH
JUST ME
LOVE SORRY TOLD YOU
I WOULD GET A BANK ACCOUNT
THAT DOESN&rsquo;T FEEL RIGHT
TO ME
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
NONE OF THAT FEELS RIGHT
DOESN&rsquo;T MATTER IF I&rsquo;M SOBER
DOESN&rsquo;T MATTER IF I&rsquo;M FUCKED UP
THAT DOESN&rsquo;T FEEL RIGHT TO ME
SO AFTER TODAY
GOD PLEASE LET ME SOBER UP
AND SURE RETHINK EVERYTHING
GIVE IT MORE THAN A MOMENT AND HOLD SPACE
THEN KNOW
MY UNPOPULAR BELIEFS
WILL BE THE DEATH OF ME
UNLESS I COMMUNICATE THEM EFFECTIVELY
AND WHNE I DO THAT SUCCESFULLY
I WON&rsquo;T NEED TO DRINKY
SMOKEY TOKEY COKEY AND LUCY
CAUSE MY EACH STEP
WOULD BE
A WALKING SYMPHONY
AND THAT&rsquo;S THE PATH I&rsquo;M ON
LET ME GO BACK TO SCHOOL
I SWEAR ON MY SOUL
YOU KNOW THIS
LET ME JUST RUN BACK TO SCHOOL
AND THAT&rsquo;LL HELP ME FOCUS
THIS TIME AROUND I SWEAR
I&rsquo;M GOING TO WORK MENIAL JOBS
IN ORDER TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL
THEN I&rsquo;M GOING TO GET A GOOD DEGREE
BUT DIDN&rsquo;T DO IT FOR THE DEGREE
I DID IT AUSE JAIL DOESN&rsquo;T HAVE A LASER CUTTER
AND I JUST NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH 3 MEALS AND A COT
AND MY LOVE MIGHT SAVE ME
AND HOPEFULLY WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE TO OUR RELATIONSHIP
IM ALMOST FUCKED UP ENOUGH TO GO TALK TO THOSE GINGER BITCHES
BUT THAT&rsquo;S NOT ME
I CAN&rsquo;T SEE
OMG MAYBE I SHOULD
MAYBE I SHOULDNT I SHOULD DEF GET OUT OF MY HEAD MAYBE I SHOULD PROVE IT I DON&rsquo;T KNOW ANYMORE BUT I CAN SEE
I NEED SOME HELP
NEED HELP
NEED HELP
HELP THAT BEYOND ME
HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP
I&rsquo;VE FALLEN AND I CAN&rsquo;T GET UP</p>

<p>YOU KNOW WHAT?
IM THROWING OUT ALL MY WORK
I&rsquo;M TRASHING ALL MY IDEAS
BECAUSE YOU CAN TALK OH YOU CAN TALK
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
I SPENT THE LAST 2-3 YEARS
CREATING EVERY DAY AND BARELY RELEASING
THE BALANCE WAS OUT
IT WASN&rsquo;T ONE SIDED
AND NOW
AND NOW
I DON&rsquo;Y CARE ANYMORE
STARTING TOMORROW
WHEN I&rsquo;M HUNG OVER AS FUCK

Radiation Mic
Let the sea wash over and allow me to question,
you, …..agents…….. of mind…….. on trial…
(They can’t hear me but I whisper anyways. The cancer growth in my lungs allows me to connect remotely to all humans’ brains, and I’m traversing the consciousness of the people related to both me and my captors Femanon 1 and 2. I can affect their brains as they can monitor and affect mine.)
