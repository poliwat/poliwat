`Guess they forgot about me.' She sighed and started walking home.`

`The lonely cholo was always outside on his low rider bike around this time. His gang was dead, he was a gangster without a gang. 'Hey bato!' The lonely cholo called at Mila. They were instant friends.`

`Now ten years later the lonely cholo is a drug rehabilitation programs counselor working directly with the mayor of their town. Mila is a woman in tech.
`

``Toasting with the mayor a glass of wine,
'I love this town' ``
