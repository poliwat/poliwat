Some would call this my lowpoint, but they haven't read or sang '4w958yrnvid'.

BS was going down at 530 and my mom and sister went and I was silently not invited back and later my mom said it was good I didn't go and that she thinks the devil got me and she laughed and I just want to kill myself cause although I told my sister last week satan's most brilliant invention was the 'word of God' - I still get spiritual guidance through bible study and the community is nice. so I just feel like trash - when you're family thinks you're a demon it's hard not to take offense. but also this is pleb tier city and helen said I'm not evil so idk I made it another day sober but this is the roughest time in my life - and its only going to get rougher
